    Grab an API key

Hello: *Sven1904*. (Not Sven1904? Logout
<https://comicvine.gamespot.com/logout/>)
Your API key for Comic Vine is...
*82040eeb3fff53a4d6865e9cc0c0478afb0b7ea4*


    Current API Usage

You have no current rate limits. Go forth and query.


    Documentation

  * API list of resources <https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/documentation>
  * API developer forum
    <https://comicvine.gamespot.com/forums/api-developers-2334/>


    What is this?

These APIs provide full access to our structured-wiki content data in
XML and JSON formats. It does not provide data specific to our userbase.
You must sign up for a unique api key for each site individually.


    Oh... and something else

Welcome google searcher. You're just stumbled into exactly what you were
looking for. An extremely mature, well organized and continuely updated
resource of comic information. The tools to build it were put together
by a few dedicated developers at CBS Interactive. The data itself comes
from a KISS-like-army of comic fans that contribute millions of edits to
the resource every year.

Now that you've found this motherload, do the right thing. Don't just
steal it and build some crappy collection app. Build something awesome.
Better yet, build something awesome, contact us when you have a
prototype and let's figure out a way to work together. We like people
that build awesome things.

For Pete's sake don't email us about your unfinished app that you might
build... Just go build the thing already, you can do it.

Or maybe I've gotten this all wrong and you're already a Comic Vine
user. In that case... good luck duder, thanks for helping us build this
silly website.


    Terms of Use

 1.


          Non-commercial use only

    You can make some great things with our API, but unfortunately money
    isn't one of them. The API is strictly for non-commercial use only.
    Commercial use will result in your API key being revoked.
 2.


          Rate limiting

    We restrict the number of requests made per user/hour. We officially
    support 200 requests per resource, per hour. In addition, we
    implement velocity detection to prevent malicious use. If too many
    requests are made per second, you may receive temporary blocks to
    resources. These features are included to help keep the API healthy
    for all of our users. If you have a question regarding rate
    limiting, please comment in our API Developer forum
    <http://www.comicvine.com/forums/api-developers-2334/>. It is
    suggested that you cache responses in your app to prevent duplicated
    requests from making unique requests.
 3.


          Don't build a competing product

    We'll take care of being an editable structured data resource.
    Concentrate on using the data in a unique way.
 4.


          Give credit where credit is due

    On any page you use our data, please link back to us. It's the least
    you can do to contribute.
 5.


          Don't redistribute in another form

    Do not edit, manipulate or reproduce on any other medium. Do not use
    our brand name to promote your work. If you want to use our name,
    email us.
 6.


          We can refuse access at anytime

    It's a free resource, don't abuse the years of work of thousands of
    contributors.
