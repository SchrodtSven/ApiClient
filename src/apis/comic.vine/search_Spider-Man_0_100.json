In order to test his new abilities - and earn some cash, Peter participated in a wrestling challenge against <a href=\"\/crusher-hogan\/4005-15480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15480\">Crusher Hogan<\/a>. He easily won the challenge and also gained the attention of the media. Afterward while backstage, Peter saw a burglar run past him but did nothing to stop him as it wasn't his problem. Later that night when Peter arrived home, he was told by a policeman that his Uncle Ben had been murdered by someone who broke into their house. The cop mentioned they had tracked the killer to a warehouse. In his anger, Peter put on his wrestling costume and went after the murderer himself.

He decided to create Spider-Man as a character with whom teens could identify, as there was a recent surge in teenage demand for comics. Lee was supposedly inspired by the concept of Spider-Man after observing a spider climb up a wall. Lee had to convince publisher <a href=\"\/martin-goodman\/4040-43801\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43801\">Martin Goodman<\/a> to introduce Spider-Man in the last issue of the canceled series <a href=\"\/amazing-adult-fantasy\/4050-2043\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2043\">Amazing Adult Fantasy<\/a>, which was renamed <a href=\"\/amazing-fantasy\/4050-5533\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy<\/a> for that issue (#15, Aug. 1962). Lee then approached legendary artist <a href=\"\/jack-kirby\/4040-5614\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby<\/a> for an initial character design. However, Lee was dissatisfied with Kirby's attempt as the character turned out to be too heroic and Spider-Man was supposed to be a teenage boy. Lee then turned to <a href=\"\/steve-ditko\/4040-4026\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko<\/a> who developed the now iconic look of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is one of the first characters whose problems made him feel more real, as people could relate more to him.<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><p>Peter Parker originally decided to use his powers to make money but after Uncle Ben's death, he decided to use his powers for good. In many ways, this makes Spider-Man less of the 'boy scout' character people think; the fact that he used his powers to have fun in the first place is something people can relate to. Initially, Peter Parker is shy and timid, but the Spider-Man alter-ego was a form of liberation and heroism, and he used it to gain confidence. However, he found the moral urge later, though some of his confidence and liberation remains, making him a sarcastic wise-guy.<\/p><p>He has an extremely powerful moral urge for good which is so strong that it made him stop working for the Pro-Registration side despite having his mentor and friends on the said side.<\/p><p>He also has a very compassionate disposition that it can be said that he isn't just the most compassionate in the Marvel Universe but also one of the most compassionate periods.<\/p><p>One thing he is well known for is his humor something that has been known to greatly irritate his enemies and has sometimes even let him win the fight. Furthermore, The combination of moral obligation, compassion, and humor makes him one of the most trustworthy, good people to hang out with.<\/p><p>The time between Spider-Man capturing the burglar that killed Uncle Ben and him becoming a superhero was told over 30 years after his origin when the <a href=\"\/amazing-fantasy\/4050-5533\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy<\/a> series was continued in 1995 by writer <a href=\"\/kurt-busiek\/4040-41741\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41741\">Kurt Busiek<\/a> (#16-18, Dec. 1995 - Mar. 1996). After catching the burglar that killed Ben, Peter had given up being Spider-Man as it reminded him of his irresponsible behavior that ultimately led to his uncle's death. Even though <a href=\"\/maxie-shiffman\/4005-25215\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25215\">Maxie Shiffman<\/a>, the agent he had hired when he was a costumed wrestler, was putting out ads to track down Spider-Man, Peter didn't want anything to do with that life. Ben had been the only earner in the family and after his death, Peter and his Aunt May were struggling for money. A salesman tried to con May into buying furniture that Ben had apparently left a deposit on before his death. Although the salesman had seemed genuine at the time, Peter caught <a href=\"\/mr-vale\/4005-83138\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83138\">Mr. Vale<\/a> pulling the same stunt on an old widower when he was swinging through the city in his Spider-Man costume to clear his head. Spider-Man followed Mr. Vale to a warehouse where he discovered a whole gang of organized criminals led by <a href=\"\/the-undertaker\/4005-83137\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83137\">The Undertaker<\/a>. Spider-Man challenged the gang and soon had them rounded up for the police. Chronologically this was the first time Spider-Man had been threatened with a gun. More significantly, during the fight, he discovered his <a href=\"\/spider-sense\/4015-56106\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56106\">Spider-Sense<\/a> for the first time. Capturing these criminals lead Peter to believe that this is how he has to make up for Uncle Ben's death, by using his powers to help others.<\/p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349326\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.66429298067141\" data-width=\"983\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 983px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349326\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 983w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 983w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117930\/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Spider-Man became a force for good, from stopping muggings to rescuing workers at a construction site. These heroic activities also gained him positive media attention but he still didn't want to get back in show business. Even after Shiffman told him they could make millions, Peter chose responsibility for money. His heroism had also earned Spider-Man a certain fan named <a href=\"\/flash-thompson\/4005-1489\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Flash Thompson<\/a>. Spider-Man soon encountered another teenager with superpowers of her own and he and <a href=\"\/josephine-pulaski\/4005-25313\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25313\">Joey Pulaski<\/a> became friends. However, it turned out that Joey was working for <a href=\"\/kingpin\/4005-1483\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">The Kingpin<\/a> and the friends inevitably clashed, resulting in Joey's defeat and arrest. Although portrayed as just a misguided kid, chronologically Joey Pulaski was the first super-powered being Spider-Man had encountered.<\/p><p>After defeating Joey Spider-Man's fame rose further. One day after seeing his aunt continue to struggle with the household finances, Peter finally decided he had to bring in some money. He contacted Maxie Shiffman who booked him an interview on a TV show. Spider-Man was given the slot of astronaut <a href=\"\/john-jameson\/4005-4456\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson<\/a> much to the vexation of his father, publicist <a href=\"\/j-jonah-jameson\/4005-1487\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J.

He attempted to disguise himself as Spider-Man and steal some important documents but he was defeated by the debuting hero, restoring his good name. Peter went on to get a job at the Daily Bugle as a photographer, selling photos to J. Jonah Jameson even though they were usually used against him. He eventually fought his second super villain, <a href=\"..\/..\/vulture\/29-4459\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Vulture<\/a>. Due to his inexperience, Spider-Man was defeated but when the villain got cocky, Spider-Man used a gadget of his own to defeat The Vulture. Spider-Man then had his first confrontation with his most dangerous villain yet, the tentacled madman known as <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-octopus\/29-1485\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Doctor Octopus<\/a>. Spider-Man was defeated by the more powerful Doctor Octopus in their initial encounter which caused Peter to doubt himself for the first time. He was encouraged by a speech given by the Human Torch to keep on fighting. Spider-Man managed to defeat the villain by knocking him out with one punch to the jaw since Ock's powers came only from his tentacles. He would follow up this victory by fighting the shape-shifting <a href=\"\/sandman\/4005-3544\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3544\">Sandman<\/a>, the lethal <a href=\"\/lizard\/4005-1488\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1488\">Lizard<\/a>, who is actually Peter's mentor and friend Curt Connors, the <a href=\"\/enforcers\/4060-32265\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32265\">Enforcers<\/a>, <a href=\"\/electro\/4005-3228\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro<\/a>, <a href=\"\/mysterio\/4005-4333\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio<\/a>, <a href=\"\/kraven-the-hunter\/4005-2475\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven the Hunter<\/a>, <a href=\"\/doctor-doom\/4005-1468\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom<\/a>, and his soon-to-be arch-nemesis the <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Green Goblin<\/a>.<\/p><p>After being defeated on two more occasions by Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus became more determined to defeat his foe and formed the <a href=\"..\/..\/sinister-six\/65-40429\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sinister Six<\/a>, a group consisting of five other villains who all share the same grudge against the young hero. Ock had each villain face Spider-Man individually so that every member could reap the glory of Spider-Man's death, but he secretly devised this plan to ensure the other villains' defeat each time. After rendering Spider-Man tired, Otto lured him to a fight by kidnapping <a href=\"\/aunt-may\/4005-1780\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May<\/a> and <a href=\"\/betty-brant\/4005-2484\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2484\">Betty Brant<\/a>. Despite everything, Spider-Man came out victorious and saved the two hostages. On his high school graduation, Spider-Man battled the <a href=\"\/molten-man\/4005-11554\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11554\">Molten Man<\/a>, who would turn out to be the stepbrother of <a href=\"\/liz-allan\/4005-15408\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15408\">Liz Allen<\/a>. During his early career, Spider-Man would frequently team up with other heroes such as <a href=\"\/daredevil\/4005-24694\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil<\/a>, <a href=\"\/x-men\/4060-3173\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">the X-Men<\/a>, the <a href=\"\/fantastic-four\/4060-3804\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four<\/a>, and the <a href=\"\/human-torch\/4005-2120\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch<\/a> in particular. Peter and Betty broke up after her brother was killed. She couldn't bear the thought of losing another loved one as she feared that Peter would die while taking pictures of Spider-Man.

During this time, Aunt May suffered from a serious heart attack. Peter would constantly blow his friends off and they saw this as an insult. Eventually, their relationship would get better as Peter became more involved with his peers. He and Harry became best friends and roommates. Peter also started dating Gwen Stacy. He would also meet <a href=\"..\/..\/anna-may-watson\/29-33193\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Anna Watson's<\/a> niece <a href=\"..\/..\/mary-jane\/29-13380\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mary Jane<\/a>. Although he was attracted to Mary Jane, Peter decided to settle with Gwen because MJ was too much of a \"party girl\" for him. Peter loves Gwen, but their relationship was strained a bit by him constantly leaving to fight crime. Their relationship was saved by Gwen's father, <a href=\"..\/..\/captain-george-stacy\/29-2479\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Police Captain George Stacy<\/a>, an ally of Spider-Man, who approved of Peter dating his daughter. Gwen's father was later killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus after he was crushed by falling debris while saving a child. In his dying breath, George called Spider-Man \"Peter\", revealing that he had always known about his dual identity and urged him to take care of Gwen. George's death caused a strain in the couple's relationship because Gwen blamed Spider-Man for her loss.

Now knowing Peter was Spider-Man, the Green Goblin kidnapped him, and although he has the chance to kill Peter, the Goblin instead revealed his own secret identity. He was Norman Osborn, a ruthless businessman who was also Harry's father. Norman released Spider-Man from his restraints to defeat him in combat and prove his superiority.

He decided to hurt Peter as much as possible as the Green Goblin. He kidnapped Gwen Stacy and held her hostage at the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man went to save Gwen and, despite being ill at the time, managed to defeat the Goblin. The Goblin threw Gwen off the bridge and, although Peter caught her by attaching a web line to her leg as she fell, the drop caused her neck to snap. As Spider-Man held Gwen's dead body, he vowed to kill the Goblin. Gwen's death has affected Peter his entire career and is a big part of his character, as was Uncle Ben's death. He tracked the Goblin down to one of his warehouses. He brutally pummeled the Goblin in a fit of rage but managed to stop himself from committing murder. In one last attempt to achieve victory, Norman sent his Goblin Glider to impale Spider-Man from behind. Peter ducks and the Goblin is apparently killed from being impaled by his own glider. Mary Jane consoled Peter on the death of Gwen and the two started to date. Peter eventually proposed to her, but she refused and ended up breaking up with him. At this time <a href=\"..\/..\/jackal\/29-10974\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Miles Warren<\/a>, a college professor obsessed with Gwen became the deranged villain known as the <a href=\"\/jackal\/4005-10974\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\">Jackal<\/a>. He hired the <a href=\"..\/..\/punisher\/29-1525\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Punisher<\/a> to kill Spider-Man and he also made copies of both Gwen and Peter.

During the battle, Spider-Man's suit was badly damaged and he needed a new one. Peter came upon a strange machine that produced a <a href=\"\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">black substance<\/a> that slithered over him and covered his entire body. This new black and white costume, similar to <a href=\"\/arachne\/4005-16197\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Arachne's<\/a> costume, replaced his old costume. Once the heroes won the battle, they were all transported back to Earth and Spider-Man kept on wearing the suit because it enhanced his strength, speed, and agility. He would start experiencing odd signs of fatigue and became even more concerned when he discovered that the suit produced organic webbing. He took the suit to <a href=\"..\/..\/mr-fantastic\/29-2151\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Reed Richards<\/a> who told him that it's actually a <a href=\"\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">living alien symbiote<\/a>, which can only survive by bonding to a host and draining their life-force away. Reed used a sonic emitter to separate Peter from the suit. Spider-Man was now without a costume and <a href=\"\/human-torch\/4005-2120\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm<\/a>, as part of a practical joke, gave Peter an old Fantastic Four costume with a paper bag for a mask and dubbed him the Bombastic Bag-Man.

The symbiote made its way back to Peter and attempted to permanently bond with him, but Peter used the sounds of a church bell to seemingly destroy the suit. It survived and found a host in <a href=\"..\/..\/eddie-brock\/29-6733\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Eddie Brock<\/a> to become one of Spider-Man's deadliest and most recurring foes, <a href=\"..\/..\/venom\/29-1486\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Venom<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Death of Jean DeWolff<\/h3><p>A close friend of Peter's, <a href=\"\/jean-dewolff\/4005-2471\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2471\">Jean DeWolff<\/a> was killed by a criminal called the <a href=\"\/sin-eater\/4005-11206\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11206\">Sin-Eater<\/a>. Spider-Man became determined to capture him before anyone else was hurt and so he teamed up with Daredevil, who also held a grudge against the criminal.

The robot that masqueraded as Peter's father Richard was perfectly willing to accomplish his task and kill Peter, but the Mary robot had learned to love Peter and saw him as a good person. Richard turned into a vicious engine of destruction. Before Richard could finish Peter off, Mary killed him using an electric cable. In return, she was killed by the Vulture who was conspiring with the Chameleon. An enraged Spider-Man completely pummeled the Vulture but was stopped by the cries of his dying \"mother\". She told Peter in her last moments that despite everything, she still loved him. Spider-Man vowed to track down the Chameleon and make him suffer, which he eventually did after fighting through many assassins sent by the communist.

For years he was believed to have died after his initial encounter with the real Peter Parker. The clone, who is now calling himself <a href=\"..\/..\/scarlet-spider\/29-6286\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ben Reilly<\/a> spent years traveling the world as he knew there was no place for him in New York City again. When his aunt May was believed to be dying, Ben returned to New York and eventually met Peter Parker. At first, the two fought and Peter saw Ben as a threat, but later on, the two of them worked together, with Ben even taken over as Spider-man for some time when it was believed that Peter had lost his powers. It was also during this time that aunt May seemingly died of old age. Before she passed away, she told Peter that she had known about him being Spider-man for some time now. Years later, it would be revealed that it was not aunt May that had died, but a stand-in that was the work of Norman Osborn. Peter remained out of super-heroin for some time, until his powers seemingly returned and he and the Scarlet Spider fought side by side for some time. The story arc lasted for two years and ended with the death of Ben Reilly at the hands of a returning Norman Osborn who was revealed to be alive and has been pulling strings from the moment he was believed to have died. On that day, Peter felt to have lost a brother. Although Norman Osborn was defeated, it was far from the last thing that was heard from him. With his powers fully returned, Peter resumed his work as the Amazing Spider-Man once again.<\/p><h3>The Identity Crisis<\/h3><p>After this saga, the <a href=\"\/spider-man-identity-crisis\/4045-55684\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55684\">Identity Crisis<\/a> story takes place in which Spider-Man is accused by a returned Norman Osborn of murder and a bounty is put on his head. This is done by Norman Osborn, who had cleared his name as a criminal when he proclaimed that he was not really the Green Goblin, but was set up by this criminal. He had taken over the Daily Bugle and put a price on Spider-Man's head in the newspaper. This lead to a variate of bounty-hunters to attack Spider-Man. Feeling it to dangerous for himself and his loved ones to remain the hero he is, Peter retires from being Spider-Man and forms four different identities which he uses to keep on helping people and in the meantime clear his name. Eventually, Peter's name was cleared and he returned to being Spider-Man.<\/p><h3>Gathering of the Five<\/h3><p>It seemed that Spider-man was finally back on track, with his name cleared and his life finally looking a bit better than it had in recent months. Norman Osborn however kept being a disturbing presence to Peter and Mary Jane. He started a ritual known as the Gathering of the Five, with one person getting Ultimate power, one got death, one got insanity, and so on. Norman thought he gained power, but it turned out that it was insanity that he got. He attacked and kidnapped Peter. While he was captive, Peter got the shock of a lifetime. His aunt May was standing in front of him, alive and well. After Spider-man broke free and defeated Norman Osborn, seemingly for good, as he was taken to a mental hospital, Peter learned that it was in fact aunt May he found. Not a clone, not a hoax. Norman had apparently kidnapped May years ago and had an actress surgically look like aunt May and play her part while she was dying. This was why 'aunt May' knew about Peter being Spider-Man, she was hired by Norman Osborn to play her! Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four assured Peter it was his aunt. Peter saw this as a sign and stopped being Spider-Man altogether, finally living a good life with his aunt May and his wife Mary Jane.<\/p><h3>A New Chapter in Life and a New Spider-Woman<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1790\/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ratio=\"1.1566820276498\" data-width=\"651\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 651px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1790\/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\"><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1790\/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/1790\/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1790\/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1790\/1509302-mattie1.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/1790\/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1790\/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After Peter had his aunt returned, he decided to stop being Spider-man for good. He started living in a new apartment with his aunt May and wife Mary Jane. All of New York was wondering where Spider-Man could have gone after his seemingly final battle with the Green Goblin. He would not even react to messages send by Peter's good friend the Human Torch. Peter had found a job at a science-center where he did good work and stayed out of the superhero life, although it turned out that was harder than it seemed. It was at this time that a seemingly new Spider-Man appeared on the scene. It turned out that this was Mattie Franklin, a participant in the Gathering of the Five, who got the gift of Power. She acted as Spider-man and later as Spider-Woman when Peter finally accepted that he was needed as Spider-man and returned to life as a superhero.<\/p><p>All seemed to go well again until Mary Jane, who had started acting again, was threatened by a stalker. It started with phone-calls, but when Mary Jane took a plane, it exploded in mid-air and seemingly killed Mary Jane. Peter, firstly stricken with grief, did not believe she had died. He knew it must have had something to do with the stalker, and Peter started a crusade to find out the truth. This brought him to Latveria and in a fight against the Hulk among others. Eventually, Peter learned that it was indeed the stalker that had faked Mary Jane's death and had held her captive during it all. The stalker was a mutant that absorbed all of Peter's memories when he was saved by him during one of Spider-man's fights on the streets of New York. The Stalker needed Mary-Jan for himself because of it and he felled he knew her. Spider-man managed to save Mary Jane and defeat the Stalker. Mary Jane however was traumatized by the experience and needed time off from her life as the wife of a superhero. The two parted ways for some time.<\/p><h3>A Death in the Family<\/h3><p>Norman Osborn broke out of jail and managed to clear his name of being the Green Goblin. After failing to convert Peter into his heir, he started to provoke Peter into killing him in a story called <a href=\"..\/..\/a-death-in-the-family\/39-56294\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">A Death in the Family<\/a>. Norman was sick of his life and wanted to die at the hands of Spider-man. He tried to get Peter so mad that he would do this. First by releasing footage of Gwen's death to the media, claiming that Gwen's death was the result of Spider-Man's selfish actions. To make matters worse, Norman forced a drunken Flash Thompson to have a car accident, causing him to go into a coma. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin meet up in one of Osborn's warehouses where Spider-Man defeats the Goblin. Although he urged him to finish him off, Peter refused to play the Goblin's game and proposed a truce. Norman accepts, but as he returns to one of his offices, he puts a gun in his mouth. He is however to afraid to pull the trigger.<\/p><h3>Ezekiel<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\"><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-man and Ezekiel<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Spider-man meets a strange individual named Ezekiel, who knows that he is truly Peter Parker, and warns him of a powerful enemy who will try to kill him, known as Morlun. Peter follows Ezekiel and tries to find out why he knows so much about him. Ezekiel tells Spider-man that he is part of a \"Spider-Totem\", which is why his enemies all are animals as well (Rhino, Lizard, Doctor Octopus, Vulture). Spider-man does not care much about these strange stories but is happy with the help that Ezekiel provides when he finally encounters Morlun. He barely defeats Morlun and struggles back home after the fight. He lands on his bed, with a torn-up Spider-man costume and falls asleep. It is at this time that aunt May enters the room and sees Peter as Spider-Man. The secret is finally out! Aunt May walks away and uses a full day to comprehend the facts before she finally confronts Peter with it. Peter tried to talk his way out of it but finally sees that it is no use and then told his aunt May about why he became Spider-Man. It was during this time that Peter and Mary Jane again renewed their relationship and their marriage vows. Marry-Jane returned to live with Peter and the two were a happy couple once more.<\/p><h3>New Avengers<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056899\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5013333333333\" data-width=\"750\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056899\"><img alt=\"Spider-man Joins The New Avengers\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 750w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 426w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man Joins The New Avengers\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 750w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-man Joins The New Avengers<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>During a riot at the <a href=\"..\/..\/the-raft\/34-50736\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Raft<\/a> prison, orchestrated by <a href=\"..\/..\/electro\/29-3228\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Electro<\/a>, Spider-Man teams up with other heroes to subdue the inmates.

Norman has revealed a nefarious plot to his Avengers involving his son Harry entitled \"American Son\". While alone, Spider-Man was ambushed by <a href=\"\/daken\/4005-42501\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken<\/a>, who claims that Peter smells too clean for Gargan. Daken attacks and uses his pheromones to shut down Peter's senses, however, Peter focuses on his spider-sense alone, and eventually defeats Daken by throwing him into an electrical machine that electrocutes and knocks out Daken. However, Harry reveals Spider-Man's disguise in front of Osborn's Avengers,(even though Norman had known it all along, and only wanted to ensure he had his son's trust) and he was held captive and tortured by <a href=\"\/bullseye\/4005-4647\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye<\/a>.

After a loud knocking at his apartment door and he opens it only to see his estranged clone Kaine, beaten and bloodied. Before passing out, Kaine reveals to Peter that the \"Spiders\" are being hunted. A loud explosion is heard nearby his apartment and Peter goes to check it out only to see Arachne fighting off Ana and Alyosha Kravinoff. Peter, being weakened by the swine flu, struggles to put up a fight and manages to impale Alyosha on a broken pipe, gaining him time to retrieve Arachne and to escape. After retreating to Mattie Franklin's apartment, they are approached by a dead Ezekiel. He then tells Spider-Man and Arachne that they have to save Arana from the clutches of the Kravinoff's. As they finally reach her, they become outnumbered and defeated and Arachne and Arana are captured. Kaine eventually arrives to help out but was too late to make a difference. He tries to warn Peter from following Ezekiel but Peter lashes out in anger and the two set off to find Kraven's base.<\/p><p>When they finally reach the base, Chameleon reveals himself as being disguised as Ezekiel the entire time. Spider-man then gets ambushed and killed by the Kravinoff's. With Kraven finally back from the dead, he shows his anger at Sasha by confirming that the blood was not that of the real Spider-Man but of his clone Kaine. When Peter awakens, he finds Kaine's body in a coffin with a note reading \"Hunt me\" and his black costume lying beside the coffin. Spider-Man begins to hunt the Kravinoff's one by one, first taking out Chameleon and nearly killing Vladimir with a giant tombstone before dodging a point-blank shot from Alyosha's rifle. Spider-man than appears on the roof of the mansion and attacks Sasha, leaving the mark of Kaine on her face (using his finger's abilities to rip the skin off of her face) in revenge for the death of his clone and \"brother\". Spider-Man and Kraven then proceed to engage into battle and the fight proves to be completely one-sided as Peter goes all out with the intentions of killing Kraven for the murders of his friends. As he is about to deliver the killing blow to Kraven with his own spear, Arachne (As the new Madame Web) appears and shows Spider-man a grim future that would follow if he decided to murder Kraven. Spider-Man lets Kraven live and tells him that it's his second and last chance to live.<\/p><p>They were still defeated by Spider-Man, Arachne, and <a href=\"..\/..\/spider-girl\/29-40598\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Arana<\/a>.

As Spider-Man, Peter has become a much more respected member of the Super-Hero community. Additionally, thanks to <a href=\"\/marla-jameson\/4005-10671\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10671\">Marla Jameson<\/a>, Peter has become a think tank scientist at <a href=\"\/horizon-labs\/4020-57110\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57110\">Horizon Labs<\/a> under the employ of known scientist <a href=\"\/max-modell\/4005-74419\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74419\">Max Modell<\/a>. <a href=\"\/hobgoblin\/4005-7605\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\">Roderick Kingsley<\/a> is murdered by a crazed <a href=\"\/phil-urich\/4005-2246\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2246\">Phil Urich<\/a> who takes up the mantle of the Hobgoblin. He takes on the mission Kingpin initially assigned to Kingsley, which involved stealing a metal called reverbium from Horizon Labs. On Peter's first day at Horizon Labs, the lab is attacked by the new Hobgoblin who is using new weapons. After a fight with Spider-Man, Phil steals the reverbium and delivers it to Kingpin who allows Phil to work for him. Spider-Man designs himself a new Stealth Suit (Which has the ability to turn invisible.) to overcome Phil's Goblin Laugh which incapacitated him in their previous encounter. Along with the Black Cat, he attempts to take down Kingpin and Hobgoblin and steal back the reverbium. At Fisk Towers, Spider-Man and the Black Cat fight the Hobgoblin, Kingpin, and his Hand Ninjas. The reverbium is destroyed along with Fisk Towers, and Hobgoblin and Kingpin escape. But despite everything, Peter is now living a life with his dignity intact. He now has a new girlfriend, a new apartment, and a proud Aunt May and Jay Sr. Part 2 <a href=\"\/alistair-smythe\/4005-6292\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6292\">Alistair Smythe<\/a> and his Spider-Slayers are back and taking aim at Mayor J.

Smythe returns Mac Gargan to his <a href=\"\/mac-gargan\/4005-4484\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion<\/a> identity and attacks the launch site where John is flying the Vertex shuttle into orbit which will meet up with a <a href=\"\/horizon-labs\/4020-57110\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57110\">Horizon Labs<\/a> space station. Spider-Man appears and web lines to a shuttle that just took off. Smythe has locked down the controls and rigged its booster rockets to explode before it leaves the atmosphere.<\/p><p>To make matters worse, the evolved Scorpion appears to kill Spider-Man. But with secret help from Otto Octavius Spider-Man saves John. He gets help from the New Avengers in defending Jonah but Smythe sends his <a href=\"\/army-of-insects\/4060-58079\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58079\">Insect Army<\/a> after Jonah's loved ones. But Spidey and his friends cannot hurt the Insect Army, they can barely even touch them, as Smythe gave them their own spider-sense. Peter with the help of Max Modell creates the spider-sense disruptor. He is given the detonator and must be far from the center of the \"explosion\" or his sense might be also caught in. But during the second fight against the Scorpion, Scorpion destroys the detonator, and Spider-Man must do it manually. And when he detonates it he is caught in the epicenter. The Insect Army has lost the spider-sense, but so has Spider-Man. After Spider-Man defeats the Scorpion, he goes to check on the others but Smythe suddenly appears and Spider-Man had not seen it coming due to not having spider-sense, but <a href=\"\/marla-jameson\/4005-10671\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10671\">Marla Jameson<\/a> did. She jumps right in front of Jonah, and saves him but scarifies her own life in the process. Spider-Man then defeats Smythe and for the first time, Jonah refuses to blame Spider-Man and blames himself instead.<\/p><p>Following Marla's funeral, Peter has a horrible nightmare that causes him to question his methods of dealing with criminals. People around him are dying because criminals keep on coming back. After waking up, a shaken Spider-Man decides that things will not remain as they are and vows that, whenever he is around and wherever he is, no one dies.<\/p><h3>Spider-Island<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056894\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4290909090909\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056894\"><img alt=\"Welcome To Spider-Island\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-width=\"447\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg 550w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg 447w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Welcome To Spider-Island\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg 550w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg 447w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-width=\"447\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Welcome To Spider-Island<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Peter is shown to be learning the 'Way of the Spider', from Shang-Chi, and also seen neutralizing a couple of robberies. Jackal is revealed to be working on a scheme, recruiting several spider-powered criminals for some kind of project. Later, Peter and Carlie Cooper are talking when Carlie reveals she has spider-powers. When news of several hundreds of New Yorkers having manifested spider-powers reaches them, Carlie web swings away to help. Peter then pretends to be another random spider-powered New Yorker and defends New York against the spider-powered villains, along with the Avengers. Anti-Venom is seen curing people of their spider-powers, as he showed the ability to do so in New Ways to Die. Jackal is seen working on the Spider-King, filled with tiny embryos. Horizon Labs and Mr. Fantastic work on finding a cure while the Avengers keep Manhattan quarantined to stop the virus from spreading. While at a lab, Peter and Carlie are attacked by Chance, Scorcher, and White Rabbit, who also have spider powers. Peter manages to defeat them using his training from Shang-Chi. Jackal has the battle taped and gives it to Tarantula to study, as he will soon be 'tested'. Reed Richards finally develops a vaccine that stops people from gaining spider powers but cannot cure those already infected. J. Jonah Jameson discovers that he, too, has gained spider powers. Anti-Venom continues curing people, however, Madame Web faints from the massive excess of spiders accessing the 'web of life'. Carlie meets up with Spider-Man when they attempt to take down Shocker, who has grown 6 extra arms. After taking off his mask, they find that his face is slowly mutating into a spider's face, and his body is doing the same. Carlie starts to mutate as well. The Spider-Queen tells Jackal that the people of New York will soon become spiders, and she will own New York.<\/p><p>Reed and Horizon finally develop a cure to the virus, based on Anti-Venom's symbiotic abilities, able to kill the virus and reverse the mutation, turning the spiders into normal people again. However, the Spider-Queen sends Tarantula to poison the serum; Peter fights him off, and Reed and Horizon manage to give Peter back his spider-sense. Peter, with his full power, defeats Tarantula and throws him into a pool of the serum. The serum cures Tarantula of his degeneration and even the Spider-Queen's mind control; the healthy Kaine offers to help Peter. Madame Web and Spider-Queen are both reconnected to the Web. Spider-Queen thus becomes a Spider-Goddess.<\/p><p>Spider-Queen has now evolved into a massive, spider-like monster, drawing strength from all infected New Yorkers. Mary Jane realizes that, because of her long relationship with Peter, she has some immunity against the disease, gaining spider-powers but not the subsequent mutations. Peter gives Kaine the Stealth Suit (immune to the Queen's sonic attacks) and Kaine goes to attack the Queen. Peter and Mary Jane gather several Autobots, outfitting each with several doses of the cure, making them go out to cure people. Peter then connects with the antennae on top of the Empire State Building, curing many people at once, while Mary Jane fights off the spider-like creatures attacking them. Kaine jumps inside the Queen's mouth, killing her by reflecting her sonic scream on her insides. The Jackal uses a disguise to get samples of the Queen's bone marrow for future experiments.<\/p><p>The following day, Peter learns from Doctor Strange that the psychic blindspot put in place to defend his secret identity has been destroyed, because of a viral video of spider-powered Peter defending people. Carlie deduces who Peter is and promptly breaks up with him for lying to her. Mary Jane admits her love for Peter, and Peter administers an antidote to her. The two look up at the Empire State Building, which is projecting a red and blue light, thanking Spider-Man for his heroic deeds.<\/p><h3>Ends of the Earth<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.76848484848485\" data-width=\"1650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\"><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118689\/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mind Controlled Avengers<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Doc Ock knows that he is soon going to die. Before his death, he wants to be remembered as the man who saved the world by stopping the Greenhouse effect. Spider-man doesn't believe Octavius, however, so he gathers the Avengers in order to discover Ock's true plan and put a stop to it. Unknown to Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus was well prepared for the fight and the Sinister Six subdue the Avengers. Doc Ock is about to kill Spider-Man, but Silver Sable comes to the rescue. She saves Peter and the Black Widow, and they set off to Octavius' manufacturing plants. There they encounter the Sandman, but they manage to beat him. Doc Ock asked the nations to capture Spider-Man (his position enabled him to do so) and he also called on many villains to take down Spider-Man. Parker knows that he can't stop Otto alone, so he asks other heroes to destroys Ock's facilities. When Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable reach the main base in Romania, Doctor Octopus activates his satellites, and every area that faces the sun explodes. It later turns out that this was only an illusion created by Mysterio, rather than reality. Spider-Man captures Mysterio and finds out that Doc Ock is hiding in Guatemala, but after Pete, Silver, and Natasha arrive at the site they're attacked by a group of mind-controlled Avengers. Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable gain an edge because the mind-controlled Avengers are unable to fight as well as they would normally, and the Avengers are able to return to their senses thanks to Mysterio's technology.<\/p><p>Black Widow was knocked out during the fight, however. Doctor Octopus launched several missiles so the Red Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor try to put an end to it. Mysterio reveals that Octavius' base is underwater, so Spider-Man and Sable resolve to put an end to Otto's plot once and for all. They, unfortunately, meet Rhino on their way, and he catches Sable and begins choking her in the water. With her final breath, Silver tells Peter to leave her and stop Otto. Spider-man is desperate to help her, but he knows that he's running out of time and is left with no choice. Spider-Man finally finds and battles Octavius, but he is eventually caught in the Doc's metal tentacles. With Parker trapped, Octavius reveals that his plan is to scar the earth, to be worse than Hitler and the other monsters, and in that way be remembered. Octopus removes his armor in order to activate his master plan, but Spider-Man tells Doc Ock that he had made an error in allowing himself to be distracted just long enough for Peter to break free. Spider-Man saves both Doctor Octopus and the world, but at the cost of Silver Sable's life.<\/p><h3>No Turning Back<\/h3><p>It's been three weeks since spider-man foiled Doc Ock's plan and now Peter is invited to MJ's, which is Mary Jane's Club, but he is still under the weather because he was not able to prevent Silver Sable's death, but while Peter is \"having fun\" at the party Carlie calls and tells Spider-man to come to meet her at the cemetery. Spider-Man arrives and Carlie tells him that the groundskeeper saw a pale man digging the grave of Billie Connors with his bare hands and then vanishing into the dark with the body. Spider-Man instantly realized that this pale powerful man was Morbius and he goes to face him at Horizon labs. Spider-Man, disgusted by Morbius' actions, starts to attack him but eventually stops when Michael explains that the reason he dug up the grave was to find a cure for the Lizard, and he tells Peter that he has already accomplished his goal. Spider-Man, hearing this, plans an attack on the Lizard and confronts him in the sewers and fights him for a long period of time, but finally, Morbius and Spider-Man stab the Lizard with enough hypodermic harpoons for Max to bring Connor's back. But the Lizard is still in control, even in Kurt's body.<\/p><p>The Lizard awakens Morbius' violent vampire side, with the smell of blood. And while Spider-Man was distracted by Morbius, Connors created the new serum that will turn him into the Lizard again, but this serum turns everyone into lizards except Connors himself, so while testing this serum Connors turns the entire Horizon Labs crew into Lizards. When he finally created the serum for himself, it turned him into a new version of the Lizard. When Spider-Man comes after capturing Morbius, Carlie tells him what has happened. Spidey creates a new cure and a battle ensures between Spider-Man and the Lizard. When Spider-Man stabs the Lizard with a harpoon filled with the cure, nothing happens, the cure doesn't work. Only at the end, we see that the cure has actually worked, and now Connors' mind is secretly in control of the Lizard's body.<\/p><h3>Alpha<\/h3><p>A teen outcast Andy Maguire went on a trip from his school to Horizon Labs, where Peter Parker was holding an experiment. Tiberius Stone, not liking Peter, sabotages the experiment, and Andy is hit with a ray of Peter Particles. Soon after he discovers he has super-powers. When he is examined by top greatest superhuman specialists, Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Henry Pym, and Hank McCoy, they discover that he has energy projection, flight, super speed, super strength, and force field, but his limitation is he can control only one power at a time. Reed tells Peter that he had discovered these particles, but didn't publish his work, because he considered the particles too powerful and dangerous.<\/p><p>He then assigns Alpha as Spider-Man's sidekick. Alpha is however very careless and eventually quits working with Spider-Man and goes solo. Spider-Man decides then that there should be Alpha no more! Soon when the earth is under attack from Terminus, Alpha is called by Captain America to fight him. During the fight, Alpha behaves most irresponsible and almost destroys planes flying in the air. Though Alpha defeats Terminus, Peter observes that Terminus' staff can redirect Alpha energy. Then Spider-Man calls Alpha for another \"analysis\" and uses the tech acquired from the Terminus to strip Andy of his Alpha power, leaving him as nobody again.<\/p><h3>Dying Wish<\/h3><p>Using a modified Octo-bot, Octavius successfully transfers his consciousnesses into Spider-Man, leaving him with Peter's memories and body and Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus's dying one. After leaving Peter for dead Otto begins to take on Spider-Man's life as his own. Peter eventually took control of the golden Octo-bot and using one of Doc Ock's own contingency plans had <a href=\"\/scorpion\/4005-4484\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion<\/a>, <a href=\"\/hydro-man\/4005-4457\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4457\">Hydro-Man<\/a> and <a href=\"\/trapster\/4005-4328\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\">Trapster<\/a> free himself from the <a href=\"\/shield\/4060-3775\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.<\/a> prison <a href=\"\/the-raft\/4020-50736\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">The Raft<\/a>. It was then that Peter tried to redo the body switch with Ock who had taken precautions to keep that from happening. Peter instead had Otto relive all of Peter's memories showing Dr. Octopus how much he had wasted his life. As a result of Peter's personality grafted to his own, Dr. Octopus decided to continue on as Spider-Man and make up for his past mistakes as the Superior Spider-man.<\/p><h3>Superior Spider-Man<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5177777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\"><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118689\/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>However, Parker still existed within Doctor Octopus's mind in the memories that he absorbed. The consciousness intent on stopping the villain and reclaiming his life tries to influence Octavius but fails to do so in any more than the slightest of ways. Parker's remnant also inadvertently causes Otto to share Peter's genuine love for Mary Jane Watson, and so pushes her away for her own safety. After Otto used a brain scanner to treat a young girl's brain injury, he decided to use the device on himself to discover Parker's presence within his mind. A mental battle ensues between himself and Parker, which Otto seemingly wins, erasing Peter's memories.<\/p><p>After Octavius tries to retrieve some of Parker's memories in an attempt to solve a reverbium related problem, Peter's consciousness begins to re-emerge, having somehow escaped the mind-purge. When Otto is possessed by the Venom Symbiote and is unable to free himself of it, Peter's consciousness again emerges and breaks the Symbiote's hold over Dr. Octopus, enabling Flash Thompson to call it back to him.<\/p><p>Peter Parker's re-emerged consciousness begins to explore his Mindscape, discovering the world is now a large empty space, with only the very few key memories left. Recalling that he's more than Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man, he declares that Otto had made a big mistake in leaving the memories that define him and promises to find a way to regain control of his body. Continuing to explore the Mindscape for clues into reclaiming his body from Doctor Octopus, he makes a note that only 31 pieces of his memories are left and wonders what he can do with them. Just then, he stumbles upon the memory of his fight with the Green Goblin at the Brooklyn Bridge, wonders why Doctor Octopus is probing into this. Deciding to delve into Doctor Octopus's memories for a way out, he is overwhelmed by the number of memories and struggles to hold on. He sees a bright light and witnesses the moment of Otto Octavius's birth. Peter Parker's consciousness struggles to fight against the deluge of Doctor Octopus' memories, but it proves too much and he convinces himself that he is Doctor Octopus merging with Otto's memories.<\/p><h3>Spider-Verse<\/h3><p>While adjusting to his new status quo, especially his position as the CEO of his very own company, Peter learned of the existence of Cindy Moon, a second person to have been bit by the same radioactive spider which granted Peter his powers. Spider-Man tracked her down and freed her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms, where Cindy had spent over a decade in voluntary confinement shortly after getting her powers, in order to avoid drawing attention. While Peter notified Cindy that Morlun was dead, he had, in fact, survived his last encounter against Spider-Man.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11125\/111254576\/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5388789\" data-ratio=\"1.5443262411348\" data-width=\"564\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 564px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11125\/111254576\/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5388789\"><img alt=\"Web Warriors\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11125\/111254576\/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11125\/111254576\/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 564w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11125\/111254576\/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 414w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Web Warriors\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11125\/111254576\/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11125\/111254576\/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 564w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11125\/111254576\/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Web Warriors<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own superheroic identity as Silk, Spider-Man was approached by a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires and family of Morlun that had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities. During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099 A.D., the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by Otto Octavius, or rather a version of him from the recent past who had been plucked out of time.<\/p><p>The combined Spider-Army were forced to retreat to Earth-3145 after their safe zone in Earth-13 had been compromised by the Inheritors, namely Morlun, his brother Jennix, and his father and leader of the Inheritors, Solus. With the help of Spider-Woman, who had previously infiltrated the Inheritor's base on Earth-001, the Spider-Army learned of a prophecy in which the Inheritors planned to sacrifice three key spiders: the Other, the Bride, and the Scion. These individuals were Kaine Parker, Cindy Moon, and Benjy Parker of Earth-982, respectively.<\/p><p>With the help of even more recruits from other realities and even a deviant Inheritor named Karn, the Spider-Army, including a version of Gwen Stacy with spider-powers known as \"Spider-Gwen,\" launched one final attack on the Inheritors' home of Earth-001. The ritual was stopped, and the Inheritors were exiled with no means to return home to the radioactive wasteland that had become the world of Earth-3145.<\/p><p>With the Inheritors neutralized, most of the spider-totems were sent home. Spider-Man and a few others stayed on Earth-001 for a little while longer to defeat the time-displaced Octavius, who had gone rogue after learning that Parker would eventually regain control of his body. Octavius was defeated and returned to the time he had come from, losing the memory of the recent events in the process. With no more problems to confront, Spider-Man and the rest of the spiders were sent back home.<\/p><h3>Rise and Fall of Parker Industries<\/h3><p>Unbeknownst to anyone, Otto Octavius had created a digital back-up of his own mind which ended up inhabiting the metallic body of Parker Industries' robotic assistant, the Living Brain. Over the course of the following months, Octavius routinely hacked into the systems of the market share to manipulate its numbers in the favor of Parker Industries.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4833044\" data-ratio=\"1.4008152173913\" data-width=\"736\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 736px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4833044\"><img alt=\"Web-Ware\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-width=\"456\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 736w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 685w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 456w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Web-Ware\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 736w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 685w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11124\/111242198\/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 456w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-width=\"456\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Web-Ware<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As a consequence of this, the company managed to expand into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries, with the company's trademark invention being a mobile device called the Webware. This change in Peter's life impacted his superheroic alter ego as well. Spider-Man officially became the mascot of Parker Industries under the guise of being Peter's bodyguard.<\/p><p>One of Peter's biggest challenges during his tenure as a billionaire C.E.O was the emergence of a mysterious biotech company, operating out of the Transamerica Pyramid, called New U. Peter discovered it was a front for the operations of the Jackal, who claimed to have found a way to bring people back from the dead using cloning technology. In an attempt to persuade Peter to put Parker Industries' resources to help his plan, the Jackal resurrected numerous of his late friends and foes, including Gwen Stacy. In a turn of events, the Jackal was revealed to be Ben Reilly, who had been brought to life by the original Jackal before taking his place.<\/p><p>The Jackal's plan eventually fell apart following the triggering of cellular decay in the clones created by New U, which led to the release of the Carrion Virus worldwide. The crisis was adverted when Spider-Man had his Webware transmit an audio frequency in a global scale which halted the cellular degeneration but not before most of the clones died. The Jackal, is a clone himself, was left for dead, though he secretly escaped and returned to the mantle of the Scarlet Spider.<\/p><p>Afterward, Peter teamed-up again with Teresa Durand, a CIA agent with whom Peter had already joined forces in a mission at least a year ago during which she was seemingly brainwashed by the Kingpin and Mentallo to believe she was Peter's long-lost sister. Teresa sought Peter's help when on the run from a government organization called the Gray Blade.<\/p><p>Hydra's take-over of the United States of America temporarily put a halt to Peter and Teresa's escapades. Numerous headquarters of Parker Industries around the globe were then targeted by the forces of the terrorist organization, namely a unit led by one of Hydra's latest additions, the duplicate of Doctor Octopus, who had gained a physical body through the Jackal's cloning technology.<\/p><p>In a last-ditch effort to prevent the resources of Parker Industries from falling in the hands of Octavius and Hydra, Parker had his employees obliterate all systems of the company, running Parker Industries into the ground. He later fought alongside the rest of America's superheroes that assembled in Washington, D.C. to retake the United States from Hydra's control.<\/p><p>Despite having his civilian reputation smeared due to his company's collapse, Peter quickly got back on his feet. After beginning a short-lived relationship with Parker Industries' former S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison Mockingbird, Peter was hired by Robbie Robertson as the editor for the Daily Bugle's science section.<\/p><p>Before Peter recovered himself, however, his adventure with Teresa continued, who discovered that she truly was Mary and Richard Parker's daughter, and shared this information with Peter.<\/p><p>Not long after Peter had decided to reveal his secret identity to Jameson, Jonah was kidnapped by Norman Osborn, and accidentally let it slip that Peter was Spider-Man. In addition to having regained his powers, Osborn had bonded with the Carnage Symbiote, giving birth to the Red Goblin.<\/p><p>Peter failed to take down Osborn despite the help from his allies, and was overpowered in battle even after Eddie Brock had lent him his symbiote. Peter only managed to defeat Osborn in a fight after tricking him into rejecting the symbiote, having claimed that any credit for his defeat would go to the Carnage symbiote and not Osborn himself. Unfortunately, the process of defeating Osborn cost the life of Spider-Man's biggest fan, Flash Thompson, who had recently become the superhero Agent Anti-Venom.<\/p><h3>Kindred Rising<\/h3><p>Following Osborn's defeat, Peter's life was presented with several tribulations. After becoming Mayor of NYC, Kingpin became publicly accepting of Spider-Man while condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate the Web-Slinger from his super hero peers. In his civilian identity, Peter was accused of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius. Unable to defend himself without exposing his secret identity, Peter had his credentials revoked, causing him to be fired from the Daily Bugle.<\/p><p>On the other hand, Peter became romantically involved again with Mary Jane, and was given an opportunity to re-apply for his doctoral thesis on the recommendation of Dr. Curt Connors, leading Peter to re-enroll at the Empire State University to earn his college degree himself. Peter also moved into a shared apartment with Randy Robertson and Frederick Myers, the alter-ego of the super villain Boomerang, with whom Peter eventually developed a friendship both as Parker and Spider-Man.<\/p><p>During this time, Peter became the target of fixation of a mysterious supernatural entity that dubbed himself \"Kindred\" to hide his true identity, that of Harry Osborn, somehow turned into a demonic creature consumed by the belief that Peter had to repent for his sins and the misery he brought on his loved ones.<\/p><p>As Kindred, Harry pulled the strings of Peter's life to ensure no harm befell him until they could meet directly, while also forcing him and Mary Jane apart by employing Mysterio to have her career make her move to the West coast to film for some months. Kindred only presented himself to Peter in nebulous nightmares to further his psychological torment, leaving him with the uneasy sensation that somebody was lurking.<\/p><p>Due to Octavius' reckless experimentations with the Inheritor's technology, the totem-hunting family broke free from their prison, with Morlun personally going after Peter. Spider-Man was successful in defeating Morlun with the help of J. Jonah Jameson and the NYPD, and managed to join the reassembled Spider-Army in the final confrontation against the Inheritors that saw the defeat of the hunter family.<\/p><p>Peter's next big challenge presented itself when Kraven the Hunter hurtled him into a hunting contest alongside various animal-themed villains held in Central Park. Accompanied by a younger clone of himself he deemed his \"son,\" Kraven's ultimate goal was to goad Spider-Man into killing him, since only dying by the Web-Slinger's had would break his undead curse. During their final confrontation, Spider-Man convinced Kraven that true strength of character was best shown through compassion and mercy. Kraven called off the hunt and donned Spider-Man's costume to die in battle against his son. Since embracing Peter's ideals turned him into Spider-Man in spirit and because his death was deliberate, therefore by his own hand, the curse allowed Kraven to remain dead.<\/p><p>Shortly afterward, Peter became tangled in a conflict between Venom and the resurgent Carnage, who had become the herald of the Symbiote God Knull and embarked in a journey to retrieve symbiote remnants of people, dead or alive, who had been bound to a symbiote, in order to awaken Knull from his slumber. Spider-Man helped Venom's efforts to stop Kasady, most notably protecting Brock's son Dylan and Normie Osborn from Norman Osborn, who still believed himself to be Cletus Kasady and had been bonded to a copy of the Carnage symbiote by the real Kasady and turned into a pawn. Dark Carnage's reign of terror was stopped by Venom when he murdered Kasady to save Dylan's life, albeit causing himself to absorb Kasady's composite symbiote, awakening Knull.<\/p><p>Kindred would finally interact directly with Peter, setting the stage by resurrecting Stanley Carter, the Sin-Eater, and sending him on a campaign of vicious vigilantism, using new abilities to strip both the powers and wickedness off super villains, leaving them with a deep repentance. Under Kindred's orders, Sin-Eater targeted the restored Norman Osborn, the new director of the Ravencroft Institute. Initially conflicted, Peter chose to save Osborn, who became the Green Goblin again to fight in his escaping Sin-Eater. With help from his spider hero friends in The Order, Peter brought Osborn to an escape pod but Osborn's antagonism caused Peter to reconsider and abandoned Norman Osborn to Sin-Eater's mercy.<\/p><p>With Sin-Eater purifying Osborn, Kindred had the collected sins absorbed go out to possess and corrupt the Order. Managing to evade his possessed allies, Spider-Man sought Doctor Strange's help, later using a mystic artifact to locate Kindred's home at the Osborn family cemetery. Kindred staged the corpses of lost loved ones in a macabre scene, expressing his intentions to Peter, and eventually revealing himself as Harry. Kindred continuously killed and resurrected Peter as a direct torture, then forcing him to sit at a dinner alongside Mary Jane to repent for his perceived sins, including what Peter didn't remember that allegedly turned Harry into Kindred. The event was interrupted by Norman, who allied himself with Kingpin to capture Harry in a Darkforce cage.<\/p><p>While Spider-Man was liberated from Kindred's clutches, Peter was shaken to his core and knew that his and Mary Jane's ordeal with Kindred wasn't truly done. While drained emotionally, Mary Jane would give him an improvised therapy session to alleviate some hurt, regaining some hope in himself.<\/p><p>After Peter accepted Norah's TNM job offer, granting Spider-Man a new suit enhancing his physical attributes, Spider-Man and Boomerang continued collecting Tablet fragments and moved to secure the final piece. Rescuing an abducted Randy and Janice, Spider-Man aided Robbie and Tombstone with The Syndicate in taking down Madame Masque and Crime Master. With help from his New Avengers colleagues and Black Cat delivering Fisk's fragments, Spider-Man passed the final fragment's curse test, but Fred betrayed him with help from his cohorts. Felicia returned Peter to his ruined apartment to rest, later reading Fred's note explaining his long con before the others informed him that Fisk instead revived his son, The Rose. Quitting TNM and donating his pay to Aunt May's FEAST shelter, Peter met with Betty returned home from Europe, surprised by her advanced pregnancy.<\/p><h2>Personality<\/h2><dl><dd><i>Whether a law is right or wrong, moral or immoral, is an idea, a personal philosophy... but it always seems that fights over <b>ideas<\/b> skip over the barrier into the real world and become battles of real violence.<\/i><dl><dd>--<b>Spider-Man (Peter Parker)<\/b><\/dd><\/dl><\/dd><\/dl><p>Spider-Man is commonly seen as a brave and righteous hero with an indomitable sense of justice and responsibility. Shaken by his uncle's tragic death, Spider-Man's vow of responsibility has led him to a path of heroism and humanitarian service. There are times when Spider-Man's sense of responsibility can be almost overbearing; this was evidently noted by Luke Cage when he felt embarrassed about Electro causing the Raft breakout, despite the fact he had nothing to do with it. This combined with his strong moral compass in the face of adversity and sharp wit makes him one of the most iconic and enduring heroes in the Marvel Universe.<\/p><p>One of Spider-Man's most prominent traits is his sense of humor. He at times is seen as the class clown in every group he is in. Even in the face of certain death, Spider-Man invariably cracks a joke, to the annoyance of both friends and foes. His reasons for this vary: either he wants to relieve the stress of a situation, or simply because he wants to hide how scared he really is during a crisis. Also, he does this to get on the nerves of his opponents, since he knows that if they are angry, that they would normally lose themselves and be vulnerable to a superior skilled opponent. It is generally agreed, however, that whenever a life is in danger, he will stop telling jokes and take the current situation with the utmost seriousness.<\/p><p>Behind this humorous facade, however, is a wounded soul that has gone through much suffering. While Spider-Man is in combat, occasionally another person dies, leaving him depressed for having failed in his responsibility. Guilt over the loss of his Uncle Ben continues to be the primary motivating factor in his super-heroics and his life in general. Peter is quick to assume guilt and responsibility for anything bad that happens in his presence or that can, in some way, relate back to him. For instance, he assumed responsibility for Electro's mass breakout at the Raft and Norman Osborn's Initiative because they were \"his\" villains.<\/p><p>Death, in particular, is difficult for Peter to reconcile with, leading him to make dramatic and unrealistic proclamations, such as his \"Nobody dies!\" credo after Marla Madison's passing. Peter has developed post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly related to Norman Osborn's murder of Gwen Stacy and Flash Thompson, which was exacerbated by Kindred repeatedly killing and resurrecting him. Peter also deeply hates symbiotes and blames himself for everyone who has died at the hands of Venom, Carnage, and other symbiotes due to having brought the Venom symbiote to Earth.<\/p><p>Spider-Man is also traditionally a loner. Due to his individualistic style, having been a social outcast in his youth, Spider-Man finds it hard to work in teams. However, this has gradually lessened over the years, to the point Spider-Man has worked actively with the Avengers.<\/p><p>Peter is also a strong-willed hero, whatever obstacles that come his way, if it's relationships, being misunderstood, or someone dying in his watch, he always gets back up. His indomitable will and don't give up attitude usually pushed him to do amazing feats like supporting the weight of a jet<sup>[344]<\/sup> and beating up Firelord. Despite being a hero, Spider-Man is nerdy, awkward, and shy. These traits have faded through the years as Parker grew up and gained confidence, but elements of the awkward teenage nerd still remain in his personality.<\/p><p>Spider-Man's righteousness complimented Daredevil's maturity as a crime-fighter during the The Death of Jean DeWolff, leading to an enduring friendship. Peter also made close ties with the Fantastic Four at the very start of his career, which stands greater than ever today, like a family rendering aid to each other unconditionally.Spider-Man has bonded with the New Avengers of whom he is a founding member, trusting them so much that he would reveal his identity to them. Of the two previously mentioned teams, Spidey is closest to the Human Torch, playing pranks on one another or seeking solace respectively, and Wolverine, respectively. Peter is also quite close to the X-Men, able to sympathize with the public scorn that mutants often face,<sup>[351]<\/sup> and once joining their faculty - though he was quick to call them out on being prejudicial against non-mutants. Spider-Man has also developed a strong friendship with Deadpool, despite annoying each other with their morals and jokes.<\/p><p>Personal Data<\/p><h3>Characteristics<\/h3><ul><li><b>Height:<\/b> 5'10\"<\/li><li><b>Weight:<\/b> 167 lbs. 11.93 stones 75.75kg<\/li><li><b>Eye Color:<\/b> Hazel<\/li><li><b>Hair Color:<\/b> Brown<\/li><\/ul><h3>Status<\/h3><ul><li><b>Identity:<\/b> Secret<\/li><li><b>Place of Birth:<\/b> Forest Hills, New York<\/li><li><b>Citizenship:<\/b> U.S.A.<\/li><li><b>Education:<\/b> College graduate (biophysics major), doctorate studies in biochemistry (incomplete)<\/li><li><b>Occupation:<\/b> Freelance photographer, former assistant high school coach, former science teacher, scientific researcher, Horizon Labs employee<\/li><li><b>Known Relatives<\/b>: <a href=\"\/richard-parker\/4005-15261\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15261\">Richard Parker<\/a> (father, deceased), <a href=\"\/mary-parker\/4005-15262\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15262\">Mary Parker<\/a> (mother, deceased), <a href=\"\/uncle-ben\/4005-3114\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Benjamin Parker<\/a> (uncle, deceased), <a href=\"\/aunt-may\/4005-1780\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">May Parker<\/a> (aunt), Will Fitzpatrick (grandfather), <a href=\"\/amy-reilly\/4005-65796\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65796\">Amy Reilly<\/a> (cousin), <a href=\"\/amanda-reilly\/4005-66173\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66173\">Amanda Reilly<\/a> (cousin), <a href=\"\/alexa-reilly\/4005-65797\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65797\">Alexa Reilly<\/a> (cousin), <a href=\"\/scarlet-spider\/4005-6286\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\">Benjamin Reilly<\/a> (Scarlet Spider, clone, deceased), <a href=\"\/kaine\/4005-8667\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine<\/a> (clone), <a href=\"\/spidercide\/4005-25666\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25666\">Spidercide<\/a> (clone).<\/li><\/ul><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5145454545455\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83882\/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-Man<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Spider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider, granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider (Achaearanea Tepidariorum) which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final, lethal dose during Parker's attendance of the exhibition.<\/p><p>The radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider's blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities. Like many superhuman powers, the effectiveness of Spider-Man's abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story.<\/p><h3>Spider-Sense<\/h3><p>Spider-Man has many abilities but the most amazing of all is his uncanny Spider-Sense. It is a tingling sensation on the back of his skull that acts as a \"sixth sense\" and it manifests when he is around or targeted by incoming dangers. It's a precognition ability that is pheromone-based and is similar to Daredevil's radar sense, increasing his reaction time and awareness. The spider-sense can manifest when Peter's secret identity is about to be compromised. It also manifests when he encounters someone who might pose a threat to him or to someone he cares about. For example, when Peter saw his roommate <a href=\"\/michele-gonzales\/4005-62208\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62208\">Michele Gonzales<\/a> with one of her clients, his spider-sense warned him that the client was actually a thug who was participating in a super-villain gladiatorial contest. While the spider-sense cannot discern the specific nature of the impending threat, he can identify which direction it is coming from and the severity of the danger by the intensity of the spider-sense. Sometimes it becomes strong enough to be painful. When Spider-Man is blinded, the Spider-Sense works as another set of eyes to avoid bumping into objects. When <a href=\"\/daken\/4005-42501\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken<\/a> used his pheromones on Spider-Man, Peter closed his eyes and relied only on his spider-sense to defeat his foe because the pheromones corrupted his sight. A similar situation happened when Peter fought the new Vulture who blinded him with acid in the eyes. Spider-Man relied on this ability to survive this fight. Of course, his Spider-Sense is a great help when he faces people in the dark. This has been proven in his fight with <a href=\"\/iron-fist\/4005-1492\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist<\/a>. The spider-sense can lose its effectiveness when Peter is too distracted, tired, or when he chooses to ignore it although it's difficult to do so because it is heavily linked to his reflexes. There were also times that his spider-sense wasn't very effective due to Spidey's previous lack of formal training, but this has since has been largely rectified since learning the Way of the Spider. Under extreme circumstances, such as fighting in the dark or against powerful characters, Spidey has often used his spectacular spider-sense in a more effective and better way. The Spider-Sense also gave him his own free-style form of combat, allowing him to go head-to-head with the best martial artists in the Marvel Universe and his H2H skill has improved significantly since merging his Way of the Spider training with his Spider-Sense. Furthermore, the Spider-Sense also allows Spider-Man to detect certain radio frequencies on which his spider tracers' signals are based upon. During Spider-Man's first encounter with the Chameleon, the villain used a certain radio frequency to send a message to Spider-Man via his spider-sense. The Spider-Sense, combined with his speed and reflexes allows Spider-Man to dodge almost all conventional attacks. Due to the similar nature of their powers, Spider-Man is unable to sense other \"Spiders\", such as Ben Reilly, Ezekiel, and Kaine. During the Big Time story, Spider-Man used a device to block Alistair Smythe's minions' enhanced senses but also disabled his own Spider-Sense. After the events of Spider-Island, Peter regained this ability.<\/p><h3>Superhuman Strength<\/h3><p>Spider-Man has the proportionate strength of a spider, thus allowing him to press 10 tons without effort and much more when under stress. His attacks are so strong; they could kill a normal person- Spider-Man has to pull his punches or kicks when not fighting foes with similar or higher strength levels to avoid fatalities. His strength also extends to his feet, allowing him to leap great lengths and attain a height of much greater than three stories with one powerful jump. Spidey's strength has made him capable of going toe-to-toe with opponents including <a href=\"\/doctor-octopus\/4005-1485\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Doctor Octopus<\/a>, <a href=\"\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/rhino\/4005-2126\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">Rhino<\/a>. He has even held his own against powerful heroes such as Iron Man and the <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk<\/a>. It's also shown that Spider-Man can break free from Doctor Octopus's nearly indestructible arms albeit with much effort, although this was due to the Sinister Six suit enhancing his strength. Spidey's strength and durability also give him incredible stamina allowing him to exert himself beyond the limits of humans as his body produces fewer fatigue toxins. He was able to fight Morlun continually for many hours and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans. After his encounter with the Queen, Spider-Man's strength had been increased to the point where he has become able to lift over 15 tons without effort and after the Other story arc he was able to lift at least 20 tons without effort. During that time, he wore an Iron Spider costume designed for him by Tony Stark which increased his strength further allowing him to lift over 25 tons without effort. He has stopped wearing the Iron Spider costume after the Civil War and his enhanced strength was erased by <a href=\"\/mephisto\/4005-2635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto<\/a> after the One More Day storyline. Spider-man's best strength feats tend to come during periods of emotional duress- for example in a fight with Iron Man 2020, where when a boy was injured mid-fight, an enraged Spider-Man jumped up to his flying height and hit him with such force the foe was sent flying hundreds of feet into a building, which was destroyed on impact. Another instance was when he lifted a segment of the Daily Bugle after the building was attacked by the Green Goblin. In both cases, he didn't have any enhancements from the Queen or the Other.<\/p><h3>Superhuman Speed, Agility, Flexibility, and Reflexes<\/h3><p>Spider-Man possesses the uncanny speed, agility, and reflexes of a spider. He can move at a speed that surpasses that of the finest human athletes. This is particularly evident over short distances. He has frequently speed-blitzed many foes- including those with enhanced speed and reflexes, moving so fast that he leaves blurring after images. He has been described as moving with the speed of machine-gun fire, moving faster than the eye can follow, and moved so fast that Daredevil (who has enhanced reflexes and senses) could barely register him, and was unable to react to a punch he was knew Spider-Man was going to land. Over longer distances, his speed seems less pronounced, but he was still able to outrun Kraven and his cheetahs (both of whom can run at over 60 mph) and has easily outrun speeding cars. However, this could be due to his preference for Web-Slinging over longer distances than due to an inability to maintain higher levels of speed over longer distances. Spider-Man can easily perform the most complicated acrobatic moves as his body is extremely flexible, giving him agility, balance, and bodily coordination that surpass those of the finest human athletes. Spider-Man is considered the best when it comes to balancing in the Marvel Universe, as he possesses excellent equilibrium allowing him to balance himself on any object. Even some of the most agile street-level heroes like Captain America, Daredevil, and <a href=\"\/wolverine\/4005-1440\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine<\/a> are nowhere near Spider-Man's level of speed and agility. Spider-Man's reflexes are forty times greater than peak level humans, and when combined with his Spider-Sense, speed and agility, enable him to dodge bullets and other conventional projectiles with ease. During the Grim Hunt storyline, he even dodged sniper rifle fire at point-blank range after the bullet had been fired.<\/p><h3>Superhuman Durability<\/h3><p>Spider-Man also has incredible durability to blunt trauma as his body is much tougher than that of a normal person. He can withstand such levels of damage and punishment that would kill non-super-powered individuals. For example, he has frequently taken blows from characters with high levels of superhuman strength (Hulk, Venom, Rhino, Puma, Green Goblin, etc) without sustaining significant injury. He has also survived the force of having a building collapse on him multiple times. This durability extends to falling from great heights. For example, he was once knocked through three buildings by Mr. Negative before falling multiple stories to the ground, yet still remained conscious. His durability to blunt trauma also extends to explosive forces, and he has taken explosions with the force of a hand grenade and recovered nearly instantly in a recent fight with the Juggernaut. In the Sins Past Storyline, he tanked a building destroying explosion but was significantly weakened afterward. The toughness of Spider-Man is such that he often rolls with the blows of punches thrown by non-powered foes to avoid injuring them- when he once decided to tense his abdominal muscles against the blows of a trained boxer, the boxer broke his wrists. Scorpion once described Spider-Man's body \"as being as hard as concrete\".<\/p><p>However, Spider-Man's durability isn't nearly as formidable against penetrative forces. He can be hurt by knives and bullets much in the same way that normal humans can and has been rendered unconscious by a tracking bullet that pierced his shoulder. Normal bullets also tend to cause Spider-Man problems as well. When he lost his Spider-Sense and faced a villain known as Massacre who utilized multiple weaponry and traps, Spider-Man decided to make a bulletproof suit from tech at Horizon labs. However, if injured by such forces, his healing factor allows him to heal much faster than normal humans can.<\/p><h3>Wall Crawling<\/h3><p>Spider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter-atomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic, and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established. Spider-man utilizes this ability in his locomotion across New York but also has the ability to use it offensively, in a manner resembling the Mark of Kaine. Spider-Man rarely uses this ability though, due to its brutal and disfiguring effects. It also works differently, ripping off layers of skin and muscle, rather than burning it as Kaine does via the HCL secreted through his palms.<\/p><h3>Organic Webbing<\/h3><p>There are different areas in different comic book universes where Spider-Man has organic webbing, which is often shown as being stronger and more long-lasting than his synthetic variants. Spider-Man has organic webbing from the movies (of course) and 616 (end of civil war, back in black, etc.) Spider-Man also has organic webbing in the 2099 universe. It seems the strength of his webbing relates directly to his health.<\/p><h3>Superhuman Stamina<\/h3><p>Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for many hours before the build-up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. He once fought Morlun for many hours continuously and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans.<\/p><h3>Regenerative Healing Factor<\/h3><p>Spider-Man has a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine's level, it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days. After getting his powers, he soon found that his eyesight was repaired, discarding his glasses. During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder, Spider-Man is rendered completely blind, however, after about 2 days his sight was perfect, albeit sensitive for about a day after. In another instance, he suffered multiple broken bones, trauma, and blood loss when he was defeated by the Rhino but was fine in the next issue.<\/p><h3>Foreign Chemical Resistance<\/h3><p>Due to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. During an encounter with the Swarm, Spider-Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings but recovered in less than 24 hours. In another example, he was able to recover from the effects of gases nearly instantly. His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies but is typically significantly higher than normal. Spider-Man's unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of vampirism. Spider-Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture; Jimmy Natale, although the extent of the damage may have been restricted due to his superhuman durability. However, Spider-Man has normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.<\/p><h3>Superhuman Sight<\/h3><p>Spider-Man also seems to have at least some degree of Super-Human sight, at least in order to assist his Superhuman speed, reflexes, and agility. Ever since obtaining his powers, he has not needed his glasses and has frequently pulled off impressive aiming feats with his webbing, although this is assisted with his Spider-Sense. Perhaps most impressively, during Spider-Island, a depowered Hercules with Spider-Man's power-set said he could see bullets in slow motion.<\/p><h3>Skills<\/h3><p>On top of his spider-given powers, Peter is of genius level intelligence. It has even been stated that Peter scored as high on some of the same testing scores as <a href=\"\/mr-fantastic\/4005-2151\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards<\/a> did when he was Peter's age. He is especially gifted in the sciences such as mechanics, biology, and physics. This has become particularly apparent during his time working at Horizon Labs, where he was able to create a device to drain Alpha of his powers in less than 24 hours.<\/p><p>He has built many devices in his career as Spider-Man and is a skilled photographer and teacher. He has developed a unique style of combat over the years. Spider-Man, even before his training from Shang-Chi, has gone toe to toe with even the best marvel fighters. His spider-sense alone is like a close combat expert and combined with Spider-Man's reflexes and physical attributes, make it very difficult for Street-levelers to defeat him when he is not holding back.<\/p><p>Upon approaching the Spider-Island arc, Peter felt vulnerable with the lack of his spider-sense. He began training under Shang Chi to create his own unique martial arts style to make up for his lack of spider sense called the \"Way of the Spider\". It was then revealed that Shang Chi was instructed by the new Madam Web (Julia Carpenter the former Arachne and Spider-Woman) to secretly prepare Peter for a future threat (Spider-Island). This style consists of among other things, hitting pressure points with Spider Strength, and striking with Spider Speed. This new martial art has considerably improved Spider-Man's H2H capabilities, and so far he has stalemated Julia Carpenter and effortlessly defeated 3 spider-powered individuals in a few seconds during Spider-Island. When he regained his Spider-Sense, he defeated a mutated Kaine who was considerably stronger and quicker than him and effortlessly trumped a mind-controlled Spider-Woman, in a handful of blows and kicks.<\/p><h2>Weapons and Equipment<\/h2><h3>Web-Shooters<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/23732\/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2269938650307\" data-width=\"326\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 326px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/23732\/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\"><img alt=\"Spidey's web-shooters broken down\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/2\/23732\/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/2\/23732\/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey's web-shooters broken down\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/2\/23732\/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/2\/23732\/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spidey's web-shooters broken down<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Perhaps, Spider-Man's most famous piece of equipment is his self-built <a href=\"\/web-shooters\/4055-42426\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42426\">web-shooters<\/a> which allow him to shoot sticky ropes of webbing which he uses to swing from building to building. They are a pair of special wrist devices of Peter's own design that contain a material that mixes with air to web-like material. They can be used in many different ways by varying the pressure and adjusting the nozzles of the spinnerets. They can take the form of strong thin lines, fine quick spreading lines, or as a thick adhesive liquid. Spider-Man can either use the webbing as web-gloves to protect his hands, as a Web-Parachute, an air-proof Web-Dome, a Web-Shield that offers protection from bullets and energy blasts, as small \"web-bullets\" that bounce off opponents, use the webbing to ensnare an opponent, tie foes up with a rope and hang them upside down from vertical poles, pulling his foes towards him, or shoot them in any direction he chooses Spider-Man's primary means of transportation is by the use of his webbing to swing around the city. He shoots a strand of webbing to a high location, like the edge of a building, and pushes his body towards any direction he chooses while holding on to the web, allowing him to traverse at an accelerated speed. This artificial webbing lasts for an hour before fading away. More recently he has evolved biological web shooters that spray webbing from his forearms but this power has been erased by Mephisto after the One More Day storyline.<\/p><h3>Utility Belt<\/h3><p>Spider-Man wears a belt under his costume that contains a built-in <a href=\"..\/..\/spider-signal\/18-56597\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Signal<\/a>. He uses it as either an unconventional light source or as a way to intimidate lesser villains. The belt also contains spare web cartridges, tracers, the camera, and his mask when not in costume.<\/p><h3>Camera<\/h3><p>Spider-Man possesses his father's automatic camera which zones in on the spider symbol on Spider-Man's chest. It takes photos whenever movement is made in front of it. He would place the camera in a certain spot and springs into action in front of it, allowing him to take photos of himself. As Spider-Man he uses the camera to capture his heroic exploits to then sell the photos to the <a href=\"..\/..\/daily-bugle\/65-40822\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Daily Bugle<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Spider-Tracer<\/h3><p>The <a href=\"..\/..\/spider-tracer\/18-55656\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Tracer<\/a> is a typical tracker that is shaped liked a spider and is aerodynamic for flight. The tracers are very small so it will not be noticed when attached to a person. The tracers contain a special radio frequency that his Spider-Sense can detect. He usually uses the tracers to track objects or people via his Spider-Sense within a 100-mile radius. Spider-Man fires the tracers at high velocity using his web-shooters and he has them coated with webbing in order for them to be firmly attached to their target. Since Peter lost his Spider-Sense, the use of the Spider-Tracers is rendered obsolete since he can only track them using his enhanced senses.<\/p><h3>Mask<\/h3><p>The white areas in Spider-Mans eye cut-outs on his mask are really clever plastic lenses of the two-way mirror type. He can see out very clearly, but no one can see in. Therefore, he can never be recognized by the color of his eyes. These ingenious plastic lenses also protect his eyes from dust, dirt, and the glare of the sun. Spider-Man's colorful head-mask conceals his facial features and expressions and also effectively muffles his voice, making it unrecognizable. When using the Iron Spider-Man suit, it changed his voice in many ways. When Spider-Man became an Avenger, a special comm-link was outfitted into his mask allowing him to communicate with his fellow Avengers as well as others.<\/p><h3>Spider-Mobile<\/h3><p>The <a href=\"\/spider-mobile\/4055-15441\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15441\">Spider-Mobile<\/a> would first appear in The Amazing Spider-Man #130 in 1974. Spider-Man would be approached by Corona Motors who offers him a non-polluting vehicle which they wanted him to promote. However, Peter turned it down and approaches his friend <a href=\"\/human-torch\/4005-2120\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm<\/a> to create their own vehicle. They customized a dune buggy to have web-launchers and a spider-signal. It could also be disguised as a regular car so that no one would suspect that he was Spider-Man. Spider-Man would put it into action but it is quickly wrecked because <a href=\"\/mysterio\/4005-4333\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio<\/a> tricked Peter into driving it off a pier. Later the Tinkerer would be able to recover the wrecked dune buggy and re-modify it to be able to drive up walls and to drive itself. The <a href=\"\/tinkerer\/4005-3144\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3144\">Tinkerer<\/a> sent it to fight Spider-Man, in which he would barely defeat his own car.<\/p><h3>Equipment since working at Horizon Labs<\/h3><p>At Horizons Labs, the combination of a well-paying job and access to numerous tech has allowed Peter to expand on the equipment he uses. So far he has developed a Spider-Glider, Thermodynamic Foam, Cryo Pellets, voice-activated web-shooters, and various types of webbing, including magnetic and acidic variants. Many of the equipment have a usage in day-to-day usage as well- for example, the cryo pellet technology was used to help keep organs and limbs viable for longer periods of time. The Thermodynamic foam also has used in the stopping and prevention of fires.<\/p><h3>Spider-bots<\/h3><p>Dock ock created specific spectators who keep watch of new york, saving spider-mans the trouble to patrol.<\/p><h2>Costumes<\/h2><p>Spider-Man has changed his costume many times but would always return to his classic and most well-known look which has varied sometimes. He has had many memorable costumes, including the Black &amp; White symbiote suite, the Red &amp; Gold Iron Spider suit, the Identity Crisis costumes, the Scarlet Spider costume, the White &amp; Blue Armored Spider suit, the Bag-Man costume, and recently he has started wearing a black &amp; green costume. You can view several of Spider-Man's costumes in his costume gallery.<\/p><p>It is Spider-Man's original and main look that has defined Spider-Man since his first appearance. Although it has seen many variations, it has remained one of Spider-Man's essential traits. During Spidey's early appearances, the costume was black &amp; red with blue shadings. In later issues, the colors change and they become red &amp; blue with black shading but some artists use the black color to give the character more depth. Also, Spider-Man was portrayed having webbing underneath his armpits that extended from his wrist to his waist. Over time, the under-arm webbing has shrunk and some artists decided to draw Spidey without the webbing although it still appeared in some modern appearances.<\/p><h3>Black Suit<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/462\/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5125\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/462\/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\"><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/462\/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/462\/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/462\/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/462\/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Black Suit<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Spider-Man discovered the symbiote costume during the <a href=\"\/secret-wars\/4045-40978\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40978\">Secret Wars<\/a> and it became his primary costume until he discovered that it was an alien feeding on him. With it, he had an unlimited supply of webbing, and the suit could mimic his civilian clothing. It didn't, contrary to popular belief, enhance his powers. After meeting with Mr. Fantastic, he decided it must be destroyed and would later get rid of it using the sounds of a church bell. It would later bond with Eddie Brock to form the deadly villain known as Venom. The Black Cat would later give Spidey a cloth version of the black suit which he would start wearing for a time, switching between it and the red &amp; blue costume. After the <a href=\"\/kravens-last-hunt\/4045-43327\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43327\">Kraven's last Hunt<\/a> story and the appearance of Venom for the first time, Mary Jane urged Peter to stop wearing the costume because it reminded her of those traumatizing events. During the Back In Black story, after Aunt May was shot by a sniper, a darkness filled Spider-Man's heart like never before. He wore the black costume to show this dark side, becoming much more ruthless towards enemies (using torture for example). Peter attempted to infiltrate Stark Tower to stop Norman Osborn, he used a black costume made of unstable molecules to disguise himself as the Venom. During the Grim Hunt story, after Kraven was recovered, he presented Peter with a black costume as a calling card after the Kravinoffs killed Peter's \"brother\" Kaine. He once again wore this costume and became aggressive towards the villains, vowing to hunt them all down. He was about to kill Kraven with a spear until he was convinced otherwise by Arachne and <a href=\"\/spider-girl\/4005-40598\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40598\">Arana<\/a>.

It was designated as Spider-Man Armored Fighting suit Version 1.1 which was made of a liquid nano-fiber. It provided Peter with the added functions of a short-ranged gliding function, increased strength, heat-resistant Kevlar microfiber that provided resistance to small-caliber bullets, built-in fire, police and emergency scanners, visual amplifications such as infrared and ultraviolet, carbon filter in the mouth to prevent inhalation of airborne toxins, and a short-range GPS microwave communication system. All of which are controlled in the computerized control system in the titanium chest piece in the costume. Another very useful addition was a stealth mode which allowed Spider-Man to blend with the environment or even disappear completely in some backgrounds. Along with this came the customization option to instantly switch between any former style he's worn (Spidey suit, black suit, normal clothes, etc); all on the same suit. It also contained three retractable spider legs called \"waldoes\" which can be used as offensive weapons. Spidey wore this costume before and during the Civil War but Tony, in order to keep an eye on Peter, had the costume feed him with information about Peter, notably the Spider-Sense. When Peter revealed that he was going to switch sides and fought Iron Man, the latter used a voice-activated override which incapacitated Peter for a while. He had already known about this and used his computer expertise to disable the override and managed to defeat Iron Man with a surprise attack. He then discarded the costume and returned to wear his original costume when he joined Captain America's team during the Civil War. The members of the initiative team known as the <a href=\"..\/..\/scarlet-spiders\/65-44648\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Scarlet Spiders<\/a> would start wearing costumes of similar design and functions.<\/p><h3>Spider Armor<\/h3><p><b>See: <a href=\"\/spider-armor\/4055-57037\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57037\">Spider-Armor<\/a><\/b><\/p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285272\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-ratio=\"1.3493449781659\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285272\"><img alt=\"Spiderman armor\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285272-spider_armor.gif 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spiderman armor\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285272-spider_armor.gif 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spiderman armor<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>While in an ESU laboratory, Peter invented a white &amp; blue suit that was made of steel plates that were from a pseudo-metallic composition using a modified webbing formula.

He also created special lenses so that he can be seen by people if needs be. The lighting on the suit can change between green, orange, and blue. Orange is for the secondary mode which disrupts sonic frequencies from infrasonic to ultrasonic but is visible. Blue is in normal mode which can be seen and heard. However, a side effect of this costume is that while he can be impervious to sonic attacks, it also prevents him from hearing others. For example, while fighting the Hobgoblin and the Kingpin, Spider-Man was unable to hear the Cat's cries for help.<\/p><h3>Future Foundation Costume<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285302\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"2.4148471615721\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:241.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285302\"><img alt=\"Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/70123\/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When Peter joined The Future Foundation he was given a new costume by <a href=\"\/invisible-woman\/4005-2190\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Sue Storm<\/a>.

This version of the Spider-Man series debuted on ABC on September 9, 1967, and lasted up until June 14, 1970. This story is about Peter Parker, a science student at a New York City university, while witnessing a radiology experiment that would be bitten on his hand by a radioactive spider. He then starts to find that he has amazing powers. He realizes that he has the spider's leaping, wall-crawling, spider sense, increased endurance, and super strength. He made himself a red and blue outfit and mask and produces a web-spinning fluid enabling him to swing from the buildings above the streets of Manhattan. Peter's first enemy would be the person who had killed his Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben would be killed by a burglar, a criminal that had run past Peter earlier at the television studio. Peter didn't really care at the time and didn't help the police. This lead to Uncle Ben's death. Angry and upset, Peter sought his Uncle's murderer and webs him. After this tragedy, Peter would become a costumed crime-fighter protecting New York.<\/p><p>Peter Parker would be voiced by Bernard Cowan, Spider-Man would be voiced by Paul Soles, Len Carlson voiced Captain Stacy, Peg Dixon voiced Betty Brant, and Paul Kligman voiced J. Jonah Jameson.<\/p><p>This series would also be well known for its theme song. It was performed by a vocal group with lyrics written by Paul Francis Webster and quick-tempo instrumentals performed by Bob Harris, published by Buddah Music, Inc. Lyrics \"Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size. Catches thieves- just like flies. Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man! Is he strong? Listen, bud. He's got radioactive blood. Can he swing, from a thread? Take a look overhead. Hey, there! There goes the Spider-Man! In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime. Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time! Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Wealth and fame? He's ignored. Action is his reward. To him, life is a great big bang-up. Wherever there's a hang-up, you'll find the Spider-Man!\"<\/p><h4>Spider-Man (1978)<\/h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.96333333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\"><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/114254\/2164020-original.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Japanese Spider-Man<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Toei Company had made a television series based on Marvel's famous hero as a tokusatsu in <a href=\"..\/..\/japan\/34-55746\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Japan<\/a>.

This was the second animated production of Spider-Man after its original series that started in 1967. This series was produced by the newly formed Marvel Productions, having risen from the ashes of DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. The company that had produced the 1978 New Fantastic Four and 1979 Spider-Woman animated series. This version's character design would be later used for the series Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series and would have some of the same people play as the same characters. The character designs for the series were based on the classic style of Spider-Man artist <a href=\"..\/..\/john-romita\/26-7499\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">John Romita<\/a> and were very similar to the visual look of the comics from the mid-60s to the early 80s. This series tells the life of Peter Parker a college student who lives a life as Peter and Spider-Man. They also used the same characters as before, such as Peter's Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson: Editor of the Daily Bugle, Betty Brant: Jameson's secretary and classic damsel in distress, and later on during the series, <a href=\"..\/..\/robbie-robertson\/29-1782\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Robbie Robertson<\/a>, Jameson's assistant. Spidey also faces some of his usual foes such as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, and the Chameleon. This also included a six-part story arc where Spidey goes up against Doctor Doom throughout the series. Spidey was voiced by Ted Schwartz in this series.<\/p><h4><a href=\"\/spiderman-and-his-amazing-friends\/4075-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-55\">Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends <\/a>(1981)<\/h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/93477\/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.83\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/93477\/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/93477\/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/9\/93477\/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/93477\/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/93477\/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/9\/93477\/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/93477\/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series debuted on NBC on September 12, 1981, and lasted through September 10, 1983.

The cartoon revolved around a 19-year-old Peter Parker (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes) in his first year at Empire State University. The story begins with Peter already having his Spider powers and is a part-time photographer for the Daily Bugle. Spider-Man would battle many classic villains and newer villains such as Green Goblin (Norman and Harry Osborn), Hobgoblin, the Chameleon, the Lizard, the Scorpion, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, Rhino, the Kingpin of Crime, the Shocker, Vulture, Venom, and Carnage. Peter would eventually get into a romantic relationship with Felicia Hardy\/Black Cat and eventually fall for Mary Jane Watson. Although Gwen Stacy was never in the series, Marvel gave us a little teaser in the series finale story arc, having Spider-Man go to an alternate universe and meeting Gwen Stacy herself. A very important story arc in this series began as the finale of Season 3 in the episode entitled \"Turning Point.\" In which the Green Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane and throws her off the George Washington Bridge, similar to the story arc \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\" However, with the heavy censorship in the 1990s not allowing television to have heavy violence, death being a part of it. Marvel decided to have Mary Jane and the Green Goblin fall into an inter-dimension vortex instead. Season 4 was mostly about the guilt that Spider-Man has to carry for losing Mary Jane. He tries to rebound with the Black Cat, but Mary Jane eventually mysteriously returns to life. Season 5 starts off with the much-anticipated Wedding of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson-Parker. With season 5 being the last season, Marvel dropped a bomb on us by revealing that Mary Jane was actually a clone created by Dr. Miles Warren.<\/p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6857\/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.68181818181818\" data-width=\"352\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 352px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6857\/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6857\/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/6857\/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6857\/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6857\/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/6857\/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6857\/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-Man: The Animated Series<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>To make matters worst, the Mary Jane clone was water-based and was made for <a href=\"..\/..\/hydro-man\/29-4457\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Hydro-Man<\/a>. Next, Marvel did a tribute to the Secret Wars. <a href=\"..\/..\/madame-web\/29-10670\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Madame Webb<\/a> was going to help Spider-Man find the real Mary Jane, who was still alive somewhere. As Spider-Man continued his search for Mary Jane, Madame Web and the Beyonder set up a chain of events where Spider-Man faced different versions of himself from different universes. One was him, where he is a rich multi-millionaire, and wears a metallic Spider-Suit, and has publicly made his identity known to the world. This version was made to mirror Marvel's popular superhero multi-billionaire, Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. Spider-Man in another reality he went to, found out he was married to a woman he never met in his life, Gwen Stacey. Gwen had never appeared in the series until now. Gwen revealed information of another Parker alternate reality. This one was strongly grieving the death of Aunt May, he cut his hair, died it blonde, and went out as Spider-Man. However, he met a foe he could not beat, the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote felt the pain of Ben Reilly as he changed his name to negate any Parker ties. The symbiote and Reilly bond to become Spider-Carnage. All of the different Spider-Man realities, including the real Spider-Man, battled Spider- Carnage. They could not defeat him, however. When he sees Gwen Stacey, his love of killing is put on hold, since he has romantic feelings for Gwen he has never gotten over. He thus realized what he had become, and committed suicide. After all was said and done, one Spider-Man had to take him with him to his reality. This one is our world. He is astounded at the fact of being an international symbol in our world, and before he leaves, he meets with the man who created him, Stan Lee.<\/p><h4><a href=\"\/spiderman-unlimited\/4075-128\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-128\">Spider-Man Unlimited <\/a>(1999)<\/h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659100\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/23287\/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.805\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/23287\/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659100\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man Unlimited\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/23287\/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/2\/23287\/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 400w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/23287\/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man Unlimited\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/23287\/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/2\/23287\/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 400w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/23287\/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-Man Unlimited<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>This series debuted on Fox on October 2, 1999, and lasted through March 31, 2001. Spider-Man, in this series, was voiced by Rino Romano (making him the only voice actor to play both Spider-Man and Batman, the most-recognized characters from both DC and Marvel). This animated series was supposed to be the continuation of Spider-Man: The Animated Series show from 1994. This series would also take part in the future. The series starts off at the Polaris One site where JJJ's son, <a href=\"\/john-jameson\/4005-4456\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson<\/a> is talking to the public. About 6 months ago, through an advanced space warp drive engine, the man-made probe called Alita projected itself to the far side of the sun where Alita recorded an exact duplicate of Earth. An Earth-like planet in the same orbit on the other side of the sun. John continues to talk about the probe being destroyed. Since then, people question should there be a man-made mission to go to \"<a href=\"\/counter-earth\/4020-54572\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54572\">Counter Earth<\/a>\". He goes on to say that there should be one to find out what was responsible for this and there should be an investigation. Peter then leaves to change into costume because his spider-sense is tingling. He sees Venom and Carnage and confronts them. The spaceship is readying for take-off and Spidey battles Venom and Carnage while wondering what they are doing and why were they trying to stow away on the spaceship. Venom restrains Spidey and Carnage tells him that nothing will get in the way of them going to \"Counter Earth\" and joining the Synoptic. Spider-Man gets kicked off the flight and gets blamed for what happens to John during his mission. Six months later, they launch the Solaris II rescue mission to go to \"Counter Earth\". The Webslinger appears with his new suit featuring nano technology \"borrowed\" from the lab of Reed Richards. Microscopic robots cover his entire body with anti-symbiote devices. He is stopped by <a href=\"..\/..\/nick-fury\/29-3202\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Nick Fury<\/a> who gives Spidey a chance to redeem himself by taking the space shuttle to \"Counter Earth\", so he can go rescue John Jameson.<\/p><p>Once on \"Counter Earth\", after almost being burned up on entry, Peter is under arrest and is sought out by <a href=\"..\/..\/lord-tyger\/29-23429\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Lord Tyger<\/a> and the <a href=\"..\/..\/high-evolutionary\/29-13346\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">High Evolutionary<\/a>.

They are under the leadership of the <a href=\"..\/..\/high-evolutionary\/29-13346\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">High Evolutionary<\/a>, are stronger, faster, and free of the primitive human mind. Spider-Man was rescued by the resistance who had been told that the war lasted for 50 years. Spidey finds John in the resistance deciding to stay until the humans are free of the High Evolutionary's oppression. Peter blends in with the humans to see what the \"Counter Earth\" world was like.

Instead, the Sony-owned Columbia Pictures decided on a reboot of the franchise.<\/p><h4>The Amazing Spider-Man<\/h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4383735\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4814285714286\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4383735\"><img alt=\"Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 700w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 648w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 432w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 700w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 648w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4383735-4855984673-Spide.jpg 432w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Spider-Man and 10 years since the first Spider-Man movie, a reboot of the Spider-Man movie franchise was launched. <a href=\"\/the-amazing-spider-man\/4025-1213\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1213\">The Amazing Spider-Man<\/a> saw then-unknown British actor <a href=\"\/andrew-garfield\/4040-68409\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68409\">Andrew Garfield <\/a>step into the role, with a supporting cast that included<a href=\"\/emma-stone\/4040-68264\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68264\"> Emma Stone<\/a> as Gwen Stacy, <a href=\"\/rhys-ifans\/4040-80783\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-80783\">Rhys Ifans<\/a> as Curst Connors\/The Lizard, Dennis Leary as Captain George Stacy, <a href=\"\/sally-field\/4040-80782\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-80782\">Sally Field<\/a> as Aunt May, and <a href=\"\/martin-sheen\/4040-68836\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68836\">Martin Sheen<\/a> as Uncle Ben.

Norman Osborn is a respected businessman, the owner of several companies, including the New York Daily Bugle. He is also secretly the super-villain known as the Green Goblin--a foe who has turned Spider-Man's life upside down more than once, and one who knows that Spider-Man is really Peter Parker! Osborn's latest scheme is his most ambitious yet: to make himself mayor of New York. But where many see that as a laudable goal, Spider-Man knows that Osborn's goal is nothing less than absolute power. Spider-Man can defeat the Green Goblin, but Osborn refuses to act himself, preferring to remain above the fray and let the mercenaries known as the Rat Pack do his dirty work.

Sega also released The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin the same year. The Nintendo home consoles were late to the Spider-Man party, but they saw many Spider-Man titles themselves. The first was <b>Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six<\/b>, released in 1992 and considered by some to be one of the worst Spider-Man games of all time. Not all Spider-Man titles followed original storylines. In 1994, Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage was released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The game closely followed the <a href=\"..\/..\/maximum-carnage\/39-41409\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Maximum Carnage<\/a> Story Arc. 1995 gave us <b>Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety<\/b>, which was released on the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo, and the PC. That same year, <b>Spider-Man: The Animated Series<\/b> was released for the Genesis and the Super Nintendo; it followed the storyline of the series, with most of the characters being represented the way they were in the cartoon. The next Spider-Man game, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Fire<\/b>, was released for the Sega 32X. This game is one of the rarest and most valuable Spider-Man games to date. For the next couple of years, no game completely dedicated to Spider-Man was released. However, in 1995 he made his fighting game debut in Capcom's<strong> Marvel Super Heroes<\/strong> arcade game (which was later ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn).

Spider-Man made his triumphant video game return in 2000, with not one, but two games, as a character in a fighting game and a special guest appearance that year. <b>Spider-Man<\/b> for the Game Boy Color was published by Activision and met with moderate success. Later that year <b>Spider-Man<\/b>, developed by Neversoft, for the PlayStation was released. The game was met with critical and commercial success. The game was ported over to the Nintendo 64 the following year but lacked the full motion cut scenes due to the hardware of the system. Spider-Man was also one of the playable characters in the arcade game <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes <\/strong>(which later was released on the Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, Xbox). In September of that year, Spider-Man made a special appearance in <b>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2<\/b> as a hidden character.

It was released on the PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, the Gameboy Advance, the Xbox, and the PC. The game broke many sales records at the time. When <a href=\"..\/..\/spider-man-2\/223-42\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Man 2<\/a> was released in June 2004, <strong>Spider-Man 2: The Game<\/strong> was released the day before. The game saw release on the same consoles as Spider-Man: The Game did, in addition to the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. 2005 saw a comic-related Spider-Man game hit the market; <b>Ultimate Spider-Man<\/b> followed many of the comic story arcs and allowed the player to switch between Spider-Man and Venom. Spider-Man, voiced by Quinton Flynn, appears as one of the main characters in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance<\/strong> and he has special conversations with Mysterio, Lizard and Scorpion, and Dark Spider-Man. His simulator disk has him saving <a href=\"..\/..\/dum-dum-dugan\/29-3526\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dum Dum Dugan<\/a> from the Scorpion and <a href=\"..\/..\/aim\/65-13497\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">A.I.M<\/a> in the Omega Base. His costumes are his classic, symbiote, Scarlet Spider, and Stark Armor costumes. Spider-Man's latest film, <a href=\"..\/..\/spider-man-3\/223-54\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Man 3<\/a> also saw the same video game treatment as its prequels. <b>Spider-Man 3<\/b> was released on more consoles than any game before it. The game was available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and 3, Nintendo Wii, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS, the Sony PSP, and PC. <strong>Spider-Man: Friend or Foe<\/strong> was released in October 2007 for Xbox 360, Wii, Playstation 2, PC, PSP, and Nintendo DS. This Spider-Man game features the villains from the Spider-Man films, but with a humorous twist.<\/p><p>In 2008, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Shadows<\/b> was released. It contained an original storyline not related to the movies, in which players switch between Spidey's Black costume and his classic Red &amp; Blue attire. Player's can dictate Spider-Man's actions, as he can be Heroic or Villainous, as related to his dependence on the symbiote. Many characters appear including Venom, Kingpin, Wolverine, <a href=\"..\/..\/luke-cage\/29-1450\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Luke Cage<\/a>, Mary Jane, and others. It also has 4 different endings based on the path the player chooses. The consoles for this game are PS2, PS3, PC, Wii, Xbox, Xbox 360, PSP. Note: The PSP &amp; PS2 versions of the game are very different from that of the PS3, Wii, Xbox 360, and PC versions. Spider-Man, voiced by Benjamin Diskin appears in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2<\/strong> and is also one of the main characters. In the Pro-Registration story, he can wear his Iron Spider costume.<\/p><p>Spidey's next video game adventure was released on September 7th, 2010, in the form of <b>Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions<\/b>. In this game, you can play as four distinct Spider-Men in four different universes, in search of the shattered pieces of a legendary tablet. The game sometimes features sequences where the player is in the first person and has to use the analog stick to win the fight, much like in some boxing games. The first dimension is the Amazing Universe (Earth 616), the world of regular comics Spider-Man that we know and love, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris. He uses mainly far-range combat to defeat his enemies, it is known he faces Sandman in this dimension. The second is the Noir Universe, which takes place in the 1940s, in a darker, stealthier, and grittier setting, where stealth and timing are crucial. In this dimension, Spider-Man Faces Hammerhead, Green Goblin, and the Vulture. The third is 2099, taking place mostly in the skies, with many free falling levels. In this dimension, Spider-Man faces the Hobgoblin with a new, more advanced look. The final dimension is the Ultimate Universe, where Spider-Man has somehow been reunited with the Venom symbiote as his \"gift\" from Madame Webb. He battles Deadpool and many other bosses with symbiote tendrils and many more attacks. Carnage is the main boss of this dimension. In the end, you battle an immensely empowered god-level Mysterio.<\/p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/49076\/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75111111111111\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/49076\/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\"><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/49076\/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/4\/49076\/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/49076\/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/49076\/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/4\/49076\/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/49076\/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spidey in action<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Spider-Man once again featured as a playable fighter in the 2011 release of <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds<\/strong> and its updated release of <strong>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3<\/strong> and versions of the game would be released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox 360. October 2011 also saw the release of the next Spider-Man video game adventure with <b>Spider-Man: Edge of Time<\/b>, developed by Activision and Beenox, the latter being given free rein after the success of Shattered Dimensions, which bears a similar gameplay concept. The game involves Peter Parker and his future counterpart Miguel O'Hara. A new villain created for the game, Walker Sloan, has created a time machine in order to go back in time and start Alchemex, the company which Miguel works for, now was established in his own views in the seventies. Miguel proceeds to stop him but is caught in the portal after Sloan has entered and somehow becomes a \"viewer\" in the events. This gives him the ability to communicate with Peter Parker, who now works for Alechemex in this time altered universe, and everything he does directly affects the year 2099. Both briefly navigate their own timelines until circumstances force them to switch, now residing in timelines alien to them they traverse obstacles in order to get home through the temporal portal and solve the dystopian effects of the timeline corruption. The two work together to prevent Peter's death at the hands of Anti-Venom, save Mary Jane from multiple dangers, and even take on the CEO of Alchemex. Currently, Beenox has been given rights to the creation of all future Spider-Man games.<\/p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4094504\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.94272727272727\" data-width=\"1100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4094504\"><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 1100w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 1100w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Spider-Man is an unlockable character in the Facebook game <b>Marvel: Avengers Alliance<\/b>.

He toyed with the idea of recreating the powers of the original Spider-Man from years ago. Miguel's boss, <a href=\"\/tyler-stone\/4005-41568\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41568\">Tyler Stone<\/a>, secretly got him addicted to the drug <a href=\"\/rapture\/4055-45135\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-45135\">Rapture<\/a>. This highly addictive drug couldn't be worked out of the body. It was Stone's way of controlling his employees by offering them the expensive drug in return for their loyalty. Miguel decided to try to genetically cure himself by rewriting his genetic code from a sample he had taken previously. He was being watched by a competitive co-worker Aaron Delgato who attempted to sabotage his experiment by adding a random code into the process. The results cured Miguel but also gave him spider-like powers. Aaron tried to shoot him but he fell from the Alchemax building despite Miguel trying to save him. Soon Tyler sent out a cyborg bounty hunter named <a href=\"\/venture\/4005-45134\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45134\">Venture<\/a> to capture him. Miguel fled to his home to escape Venture. Grabbing a costume from a Day of the Dead celebration he fought Venture and won.

As head of Research and Development at Parker Industries, he managed to create a temporal portal to his future, one he would often check to see if his world had returned to his previous status, while he created programs to compete against Alchemax.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">His efforts would be interrupted when he and his girlfriend, Tempest, were almost killed in a terrorist attack.

They are currently running Nueva York for Alchemax. It wasn\u2019t long though before revolutionaries led by his brother, Gabriel, rescued Miguel. They did so with the help of the Six\u2019s Goblin, who was actually Jennifer D\u2019Angelo, a mole for Gabriel. Since they remembered Miguel but he didn\u2019t remember them, they filled him in on the 2019 Guerilla War that was responsible for the current state of his present. He was able to return to the present using the temporal portal in his lab back in Peter's present.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Civil War 2099<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-9223672\" data-ratio=\"1.5170670037927\" data-width=\"791\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 791px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-9223672\"><img alt=\"Wanted\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg 791w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wanted\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg 791w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/9223672-ezgif-5-ad7e799051.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Wanted<\/figcaption><\/figure><p dir=\"ltr\">After conferring with a fellow refugee from his time, <a href=\"\/captain-america-2099\/4005-118967\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-118967\">Captain America 2099<\/a>, about how the future changed again, she went through the time portal to find her family. Opening the portal for that brief moment allowed the prophetic Inhuman, <a href=\"\/profiler\/4005-129496\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-129496\">Ulysses<\/a>, to have a vision of the future, which he passed on to Parker Industries about this Cap\u2019s death. With this info, Miguel went through the portal to stop it from happening. He found 2099 had shifted once more. The Sinister Six are no longer in control, and superhumans have been outlawed.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Not long after he arrived, Miguel was arrested by <a href=\"\/punisher-2099\/4005-7613\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7613\">Gallows<\/a>, who never became the Punisher in this version of 2099.

Together, they align with a team of supers standing against Alchemax and their Anti-Powers Act. They had previously helped Cap track down her husband. Unfortunately, Cap\u2019s husband called the authorities on her, and she was taken to SHIELD by the Power Pack.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The CEO of Alchemeax, J.J. Jameson, plans to use her as bait to lure Spider-Man out in the open. Despite its obviousness, Miguel still managed to convince the rebel supers to join him in the fight. He arranged for them to assault SHIELD headquarters so that he could sneak into Alchemax and confront Jameson. He turned out to be a Skrull, so deep undercover that not even he knew. The shock of it broke his spirit and allowed Miguel to leave with Cap.

With Cap 2099 by his side, they continued to look into The Fist, which caused them to cross paths with <a href=\"\/elektra\/4005-1802\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra<\/a>, who targeted them since they were a splinter group of The Hand. While investigating where Miguel was trapped in a time machine, they found only <a href=\"\/iron-man-2099\/4005-118968\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-118968\">Iron Man 2099<\/a> (Sonny Frisco), who had been brainwashed into helping The Fist. Sonny was a promising new resource, but Miguel was distracted when Tempest awoke from the coma she was in since The Fist\u2019s first attack.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">She had been taken by Tyler Stone, Miguel\u2019s estranged father and rival from 2099. He was working with The Fist and had the 2099 Sinister Six in his employ. <a href=\"\/electro-2099\/4005-130134\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-130134\">Electro 2099<\/a> was sent after Sonny, but Miguel was able to stop him. With Lyla\u2019s help, they tricked him into revealing the future event that kicks off the warped version of 2099 that Miguel keeps returning to. With a new target date, Miguel has his temporal portal adjusted so he can travel to that fateful day.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Miguel tracks down Tyler Stone who is about to release a deadly toxin. Tyler is protected by members of the Sinister Six 2099, but Miguel gets back up from heroes from this present: Tempest as a wasp humanoid and <a href=\"\/gabriel-ohara-ii\/4005-180532\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-180532\">Gabriel<\/a>, the son he will have with Tempest using his old costume. Gabri stabs Stone, and the toxic vile was recovered. The rest of The Fist went on the run.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">With the toxin recovered, his true 2099 has returned. He returns Captain America to her future and promotes Sonny to his job at Parker Industries. He then sets out to rescue Tempest from Tyler in this present despite learning he will die doing so. With Tempest safe and Miguel killed, he awakes once more in 2099, rescued by Cap and Strange. However, he is unable to return to his family since the historical records say he truly died that day.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">The End of 2099<\/h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In the year 2099, reality began to slowly warp, getting exponentially worse. Miguel confronted Doom, but Doom took no responsibility. Instead, he sent Miguel back through time to get help. This would have normally caused the timeline to collapse after his last time travel adventure, but the collapse was already happening.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Miguel fell through time and landed back on Earth-616 in the present yet again. He landed on an offshore oil platform belonging to <a href=\"\/roxxon\/4060-56010\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56010\">Roxxon<\/a> during a disaster bigger than Deepwater Horizon. He couldn\u2019t remember how he got to the present or how to use his spider-powers. He only knew he needed Peter\u2019s help. While being chased by Roxxon goons, Miguel eventually catches up to Peter and informs him of what\u2019s going on before disappearing from the timeline.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once Miguel disappears from the timeline, the resulting temporal energy surge powers a probability device created by an <a href=\"\/empire-state-university\/4020-43783\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\">ESU<\/a> student. Spider-Man is able to use the device to predict the best course of action to sway the timeline damage, which was caused by Doctor Doom overreacting to an assassination attempt on one of his <a href=\"\/doombots\/4060-59485\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59485\">Doombots<\/a>.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once the timeline stabilized, Miguel reappeared and washed up on an island. While searching the beach town, he found Tempest with his son, given a second chance at having a family.

He was sent to an area called The Ravage, where prolonged exposure causes fatal mutations. He was looking for a useful mutation when he found a spider humanoid mutate. He took a number of tissue samples during an autopsy and isolated the genetic sequence. Miguel was racked with guilt because his work wasn\u2019t more helpful to those who needed it.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">After trying to score drugs in the boroughs and arguing with his bleeding heart brother, Miguel ran into an old man who claimed to be the previous version of Miguel. The older him filled Miguel in on the Forgotten Age (the present fo Earth-616) about noble heroes standing between destruction and everyone else. They were memories stolen by Doom, and old Miguel believes young Miguel was the key to fixing it. He needed to use the spider humanoid genetics to become Spider-Man<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Miguel rejected it at first, but his brother was the victim of Alchemax. He had broken into Miguel\u2019s apartment to steal confidential files about Alchemax\u2019s secret business, and the company responded by blowing up Miguel\u2019s apartment, killing Gabriel in the process. This was the trigger than pushed Miguel into willingly becoming the Spider-Man of 2099.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Exodus<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-9223914\" data-ratio=\"0.95076923076923\" data-width=\"975\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 975px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-9223914\"><img alt=\"Spidey protects the garden\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg 975w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey protects the garden\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg 975w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/9223914-rco004_1662592879.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spidey protects the garden<\/figcaption><\/figure><p dir=\"ltr\">When an Illuminati type group called The Cabal kills a Celestial, it crashes near Nueva York.

Led by <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn<\/a>, who learned to extend his life, The Cabal has placed a bounty on the garden, and Miguel is afraid it will cause chaos as civilians compete to secure it for the prize.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Miguel collected a group of allies that could assist him in protecting the garden. Ghost Rider 2099 got him in touch with <a href=\"\/winter-soldier-13\/4005-181124\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-181124\">Winter Soldier 13<\/a>. She helped take down the Murmurnet satellite, shutting down the gig economy that was offering the bounty.

Miguel, with his new partner, Spider-Woman, had to walk a thin line of allowing them to speak but stopping them before they got violent. This was made more difficult by Carnage, who joined the protests for the sole purpose of instigating riots. He was able to stab Miguel in the leg causing the wound to immediately fester.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">He needed the help of Ghost Rider and <a href=\"\/dr-wesley-nakao\/4005-183210\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-183210\">Blade<\/a>, who tended to his wounds and helped him and Spider-Woman strategize against this version of <a href=\"\/carnage-2099\/4005-185387\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-185387\">Carnage<\/a>, which shows signs of vampirism.

Carnage had new allies though, specifically <a href=\"\/halloween-jack\/4005-15571\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15571\">Halloween Jack<\/a>, who was posing as a member of the Alchemax board, and a spider-android called Flipside that Alchemax had developed.

It appears the UMF also protects against acid which Miguel notes in his battle against Venom 2099 who was secreting a skin-eating acid.<\/p><p>Miguel received a new high-tech outfit, courtesy of Peter Parker that improved upon his original suit. This time the Unstable Molecules were bonded to kevlar, greatly increasing its durability.

This resulted into the creation of an alternate 2099 reality, known as Earth 6375. Rather than being hunted by Alchemax, Miguel decided to join the Exiles in trying to fix time-lines that went wrong. He had remained with the team for various missions, his intellect helping to save the day on many ocassions. When all of the members were scattered throughout different realities, Miguel was thrown into the past of his own reality and decided to settle on that alternate earth (Earth-6375) with a new girlfriend, that reality's Mary Jane Watson.<\/p><p>Not much was heard from Miguel untill a few months later, when he noticed, thanks to some Exiles equipment he took with him, that a group of beings known as the Inheritors had been killing Spider-like heroes through the multiverse. Miguel had taken it upon himself to warn other heroes of this looming thread. While he was spying on one of the Inheritors, Morlun, the foe noticed his presence. Miguel quickly aborted the spying and tried to travel to Earth 616 to warn his Earth 928 counterpart (whom was currently staying in that reality) about Morlum. But right at the moment that Miguel made contact with that reality, and was about to travel through it, he was caught and killed by Morlun. His girlfriend was left behind in grief and disgust. It was later revealed that the 'main' Spider-Man 2099 of the 928 reality had received the Exiles armband from the Exiles' Spider-Man 2099. It was used by him in order to help the other Spider-Men in defeating the Inheritors.<\/p><h3>Time Storm<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1850302\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1133333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1850302\"><img alt=\"Spider-man 2099 &amp; Human Torch 2099\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" data-width=\"574\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 574w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man 2099 &amp; Human Torch 2099\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/82665\/1850302-833145_2099_visions011_super.jpg 574w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" data-width=\"574\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-man 2099 &amp; Human Torch 2099<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A different version of Spider-Man 2099 appearaned in the Time-Storm mini-series.

They, as their symbiotic nature suggests, depend on other beings to help them sustain their life force. In exchange for this relationship, the symbiote offers great powers to its host. Unfortunately for the host, the symbiotes are not keen on the idea of separating and eventually start to fully consume both mind and body of their hosts.

The creature bonded with him, but Deadpool quickly abandoned it, reasoning that it would be cruel to force a sentient being to bond with a twisted creature like him. It is implied that bonding with Deadpool's severely fractured psyche may be part of the reason for the symbiote's violent and possessive behavior. The symbiote capsule was then found by Spider-Man, whose red and blue tights had been ripped to tatters during a previous battle. When Spider-Man grabbed the little black ball, it instantly slithered over his body, covering him from head to toe. But it did not pattern itself after his red-and-blue costume. Rather, it took on the appearance of the garment worn by Julia Carpenter, the new <a href=\"\/julia-carpenter\/4005-16197\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Spider-Woman<\/a>, whom Spider-Man had been admiring. The web-slinger was amazed at the properties of his new suit, but never questioned the mechanisms behind them. For instance, it could mimic any type of clothing whatsoever, making Spider-Man\u2019s need for spare clothing obsolete. It also contained a \"dimensional aperture\" where he could place his camera, spare change, and other items without adding bulk to the costume. The costume was also capable of generating its own organic webbing. When the other super heroes that were with him used the machine, their clothes did not give\/add any new powers to them.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4775973-3423215811-Secre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4775973\" data-ratio=\"1.5183333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4775973-3423215811-Secre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4775973\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man acquires the Alien Costume.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4775973-3423215811-Secre.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4775973-3423215811-Secre.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4775973-3423215811-Secre.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man acquires the Alien Costume.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4775973-3423215811-Secre.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4775973-3423215811-Secre.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4775973-3423215811-Secre.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-Man acquires the Alien Costume.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Once Spider-Man returned to Earth, the alien costume could not tolerate being separated from its host for long periods of time. At night, when Spider-Man\u2019s alter ego, Peter Parker slept, the Symbiote would take control of him and battle evil. Peter realized that when he always woke up from bed, he is still exhausted. Later, Spider-Man battled the <a href=\"..\/..\/puma\/29-15238\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Puma<\/a>, who perceived that the wall-crawler\u2019s webs were organic. Startled by this revelation, Spider-Man accepted <a href=\"..\/..\/mr-fantastic\/29-2151\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Reed Richards<\/a>' offer to study the costume. Richards learned that the costume was actually a living alien Symbiote, a parasite trying to graft itself permanently to Spider-Man both mentally and physically. Richards succeeded in separating the alien costume from its host by shooting it with a \"sonic blaster.\" He then contained the being in a special environmental cell. But the alien was much more intelligent than anyone perceived. It tried to hypnotize <a href=\"..\/..\/franklin-richards\/29-2469\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Franklin Richards<\/a>, but failed. Unfortunately not stopping it, it escaped from its cell and made its way to Peter Parker\u2019s closet where it waited, disguised as a spare red-and-blue costume. Spider-Man unwittingly donned the costume, which immediately made itself apparent. He brought it to the tower at Our Lady of Saints Church gambling the intense sound of its bells would destroy it. Spider-Man lost the gamble, and he succumbed to the bells before the costume did. However, the empathic parasite had preyed upon the emotions of Spider-Man long enough to learn how to feel, and in feeling, to act. Sacrificing itself, the alien costume saved Spider-Man then crawled away to die. In actuality the Symbiote, weak and dying, slithered down into the church where Eddie Brock knelt in prayer at the altar. Raised a Catholic, he begged forgiveness for the suicide he was contemplating.<\/p><h3>Eddie Brock<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2162558\" data-ratio=\"1.6686746987952\" data-width=\"1328\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1328px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:166.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2162558\"><img alt=\"Following Parker's rejection, the symbiote's next host was Eddie Brock.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" data-width=\"383\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg 1328w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg 383w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Following Parker's rejection, the symbiote's next host was Eddie Brock.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg 1328w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/2162558-eddie_brock___venom.jpg 383w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" data-width=\"383\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Following Parker's rejection, the symbiote's next host was Eddie Brock.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Eddie Brock had been a successful columnist for the newly revived <a href=\"..\/..\/daily-globe\/65-56979\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Daily Globe<\/a> until he began writing a series of articles about the \" <a href=\"..\/..\/sin-eater\/29-11206\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sin-Eater<\/a> murders\". A bogus offender had confessed to Brock about committing the murders. While protecting the murderer\u2019s identity under the First Amendment, Brock wrote a series of stories in the Globe detailing his dialogue with the supposed killer, until mounting pressure from the authorities forced him to write an exclusive revealing the murderer's name. Although that edition of the paper sold out immediately, Spider-Man soon revealed the true identity of the Sin-Eater to be Detective <a href=\"..\/..\/sin-eater\/29-11206\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Stan Carter<\/a>, making Brock a laughingstock among his fellow journalists. Fired from the Daily Globe, he was forced to write venomous drivel for scandal newspapers. Brock's wife left him, and his future appeared to be over. Brock blamed his predicament on Spider-Man.<\/p><p>Soon after, Brock began an intense physical workout program hoping to reduce the stress his life had become. However, such physical exertions only increased his violent obsession with Spider-Man. Although his body had been honed to near-perfection, Brock\u2019s mind was reduced to an all-consuming vessel of hatred. It was this fierce emotion that attracted the empathic parasite. In order to survive, the alien costume had to feed off the nearest and greatest source of emotion. The Symbiote joined mentally and physically with Brock, whose emotions overwhelmed the already confused alien. The dominant thought on both their minds was that of Spider-Man. But Brock\u2019s sheer hatred for the crime fighter twisted the Symbiote\u2019s feelings to a similar extent. In effect, Brock\u2019s emotions drove the Symbiote insane, just as their bonding may have driven Brock over the edge. Brock soon discovered that the costume gave him all the powers of Spider-Man, and more. It also added bulk to his already large frame and increased his strength to superhuman levels. Calling himself \"Venom\", Brock directed the costume to sprout a hideous grin and plotted his revenge. Through the costume, Venom learned a great deal about Spider-Man, including his secret identity.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/230295-15130-venom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230295\" data-ratio=\"1.135\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/230295-15130-venom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230295\"><img alt=\"Brock reveals himself to Spidey.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" data-width=\"563\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/230295-15130-venom.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/230295-15130-venom.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Brock reveals himself to Spidey.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/230295-15130-venom.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/230295-15130-venom.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" data-width=\"563\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Brock reveals himself to Spidey.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Brock taunted Peter Parker with minor assaults, such as pushing him in front of a moving subway train. The alien costume could cancel out the wall-crawler\u2019s spider-sense presumably by projecting conflicting frequencies upon Spider-Man's brain waves. Venom finally made a bold move when he confronted Parker\u2019s wife, Mary Jane, at their old Chelsea apartment. Although Venom\u2019s twisted sense of morality did not allow him to physically harm Mary Jane, Spider-Man immediately realized the nature of this threat. Taking the time to retrieve the sonic blaster from the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man challenged Venom at Our Lady of Saints Church. Although he fired the blaster at Venom, Spider-Man soon discovered that the Symbiote could not be separated from Brock because it had completely bonded with him. Trying to escape and rethink his options, Spider-Man was caught unaware by Venom. He captured Spider-Man and secured him to the inside of the church bell with a considerable amount of webbing. Spider-Man narrowly escaped the bell\u2019s crushing clapper before defeating Venom by forcing him to deplete his webbing supply, of which the alien Symbiote was actually comprised. Before the alien could regenerate enough of its mass to become a renewed threat, Spider-Man brought Venom to the Fantastic Four who imprisoned him in a sonic containment cell.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-664871\" data-ratio=\"0.57603686635945\" data-width=\"1736\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1736px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-664871\"><img alt=\"The symbiote tries to re-establish its link with Peter.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg 1736w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The symbiote tries to re-establish its link with Peter.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg 1736w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/664871-eeyaaaaagh_.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The symbiote tries to re-establish its link with Peter.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Sometime later, the Fantastic Four shipped Venom to <a href=\"\/the-vault\/4020-43582\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43582\">The Vault,<\/a> a government prison for super-powered criminals located in the Colorado Rockies. A young guard named Hugh Taylor, who had just been assigned to the Vault, was fooled into thinking that Venom was a fallen colleague and released the gate mechanism which imprisoned the criminal. With a bit of remorse, Venom then killed the naive guard and promptly made his escape to <a href=\"..\/..\/new-york-city\/34-41183\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">New York City<\/a> where he once again confronted Spider-Man. This time Spider-Man used psychological warfare upon Venom, by taunting the alien symbiote to return to him. The alien, torn by its love-hate relationship for Spider-Man, tried to leave Brock and re-establish its link with its original owner. Brock, greatly distressed by what was happening, pleaded with the symbiote to remain with him but it ignored his pleas. The symbiote begins its slithery flow onto Parker's body, when the trauma of trying to detach itself from Brock\u2019s nervous system was too much to bear. The alien costume and Eddie Brock were both knocked unconscious and were subsequently returned to the Vault, where they were incarcerated.

Venom unintentionally became involved in the plot when the two attempted to follow him through the sewers in the hope of finding Spider-Man. Unfortunately for them, Venom escaped the sewers in his human guise. After yet another fight with Spider-Man, Styx and Stone found the two and attempted to kill Spider-Man. Fortunately for Spidey, albeit in a bad way, Venom would not allow anyone else to kill Spider-Man, save himself. Attacking the two, the fight ensued. Styx, the living cancer, touched the Symbiote, killing it in the process. With the Symbiote seemingly dead, Eddie Brock was sent to a normal prison. However, later, it was revealed the Symbiote was merely sent into a comatose state, seemingly immune to Earthly diseases. Returning to Eddie Brock, the two easily escaped. In the breakout, however, the suit left a small spawn behind it, which would bond with Eddie's cell mate, <a href=\"..\/..\/carnage\/29-1490\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cletus Kasady<\/a>. No one would know about this for months. Eddie brought Spider-Man to an island in the Caribbean, away from people and innocents, in the hope of killing him alone. However, Spider-Man later realized that Venom would only be happy if he knew that Spider-Man was dead. Faking his death, Spider-Man made Venom believe that he had died. Happy at last, Venom thought there was no reason to return to civilization, having all he needed on the island, and stayed there.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-501993\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.88219895287958\" data-width=\"764\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 764px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-501993\"><img alt=\"Carnage, Spider-Man and Venom.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg 764w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Carnage, Spider-Man and Venom.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg 764w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Carnage, Spider-Man and Venom.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A few months later, however, the psychotic serial killer known only as <a href=\"..\/..\/carnage\/29-1490\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Carnage<\/a> emerged, beginning a slaughter spree throughout <a href=\"..\/..\/new-york-city\/34-41183\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Manhattan<\/a>, in which hundreds died.

When Venom saw that Spider-Man was in fact still alive, he attacked the two. A brief spat ensued, after which Venom listened to Spider-Man's reasoning. Venom agreed to help Spider-Man stop Carnage in exchange for his freedom. Spider-Man reluctantly obliged, starting the first of many uneasy alliances between the two.<\/p><p>Once they returned to New York, the combined efforts of Venom and Spider-Man to stop Carnage's rampage on two separate occasions were met with equal failure.

Spider-Man encountered one of the new symbiotes, a female human joined with a symbiote, and followed her back to the Life Foundation.

The five new symbiote tested out their powers against the combined efforts of Spider-Man and Venom, but their symbiotes where seemingly destroyed by a machine triggered by Venom, and the human host where thought dead after the Life Foundation complex self-destructed. Having escaped the exploding building, the two spider-powered foes would join forces against Roland Treece and prevent him from killing all of the inhabitants of the underground city.

When Venom and Spider-Man fought, Eddie Brock got into the skirmish and the Symbiote suddenly left Gargan to bond again to Brock, but his skin acted like a corrosive when the Symbiote tried to attached itself. White substance began to appear from Brock's pores and became Anti-Venom. <a href=\"..\/..\/eddie-brock\/29-6733\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Anti-Venom<\/a> battled Venom and seemingly \"cleansed\" Gargan of the Symbiote but also inadvertently cleansing Spider-Man remaining Symbiote within his body along with his spider powers. Venom appeared again to battle Anti-Venom, but this time he is wearing a scorpion armor to protect the recovering Symbiote. When Gargan was able to stabbed his stinger to Anti-Venom, the wound seemingly killed the Anti-Venom Symbiote and just as he was about to kill him, the Venom Symbiote stopped Gargan and said that it still had feelings for Brock and that he should live. Gargan vowed to kill Brock when he gets a chance, and Brock says the same.<\/p><h3>Secret Invasion<\/h3><p>After returning from another mission (it ended abruptly when Venom ate the target) the Thunderbolts were attacked by <a href=\"..\/..\/captain-marvel\/29-1472\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Captain Marvel<\/a> during <a href=\"..\/..\/secret-invasion\/39-47264\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Secret Invasion<\/a>. When Venom tried to stop him he was sent flying through a window and below <a href=\"..\/..\/thunderbolts-mountain\/34-53342\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Thunderbolts Mountain<\/a>. It was later on discovered that <a href=\"..\/..\/captain-marvel\/29-1472\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Captain Marvel<\/a> was a <a href=\"..\/..\/skrulls\/65-40668\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Skrull.<\/a> Nobody knew what was happening except for <a href=\"..\/..\/norman-osborn\/29-58812\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Norman Osborn<\/a>. Earth was at war. The Thunderbolts had been sent to protect Washington. When they arrived, Venom thrived in battle, eating as many Skrulls as he could. Later on he was attacked by a <a href=\"..\/..\/super-skrulls\/65-57545\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">super Skrull<\/a>, and they were both sent flying off they ship that they were on. They both landed among a crowd, and the Skrull quickly changed its shape. Venom, knowing it was hiding then began suffocating people in the crowd with tendrils, trying to find it. When Osborn saw this he reminded the Symbiote that while he was all for letting it fulfill its urges, there did have to be guidelines. Venom then continued to do what he was doing before. The Skrull saw all of this and, while changing back into its battle form, called Venom a monster saying that humans would liberate the Skrulls after seeing this. Venom then revealed that it was an act, and that the people had been able to breath the entire time. He said he did this to make the Skrull come out of hiding. Venom then proceeded to attack the Skrull. He badly wounded it with his claws and then started eating it. After Washington, the Thunderbolts continued on to New York, where <a href=\"..\/..\/iron-man\/29-1455\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Iron Man<\/a> had summoned all the heroes for a final battle against the Skrulls in Central Park. When they arrived, Osborn reminded the Thunderbolts that Skrulls were the target. Venom began to complain, saying that Spider-Man was nearby. He was quickly made quiet. Throughout the battle , Venom continued to kill and eat Skrulls, and was only seen harmed once when he was punched by a Skrull taking on the persona of <a href=\"..\/..\/hank-pym\/29-2247\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Giant Man<\/a>. Venom and the rest of the Thunderbolts made it through the Secret Invasion unharmed, excluding the death of <a href=\"..\/..\/andreas-strucker\/29-4815\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Swordsman<\/a>'s <a href=\"..\/..\/andrea-strucker\/29-4814\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">sister<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-748480\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5179968701095\" data-width=\"639\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 639px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-748480\"><img alt=\"Mac Gargan, the Sinister Spider-Man.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg 639w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mac Gargan, the Sinister Spider-Man.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg 639w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/26163\/748480-743427_mac_spider_man.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mac Gargan, the Sinister Spider-Man.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When Norman Osborn became head of the superhero community, he formed a new team of <a href=\"..\/..\/avengers\/65-3806\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Avengers<\/a> called the <a href=\"..\/..\/dark-avengers\/65-55990\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dark Avengers<\/a>, where he recruits Venom to be on the team. He first fed Venom with a Skrull impersonating Spider-Man and fed him a medication that turns his monstrous form in to more humane look and named him the Spider-Man of the group. As a member of the Dark Avengers, their first mission is to come to the rescue of <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-doom\/29-1468\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Doctor Doom<\/a> who was being defeated by <a href=\"..\/..\/morgan-le-fey\/29-52191\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Morgan Le Fey<\/a>.

In her return, Morgan took control of Venom and started attacking his own teammates. After Morgan is defeated, Sinister Spider-Man is returned to normal. Since this incident, Venom also played a part in Osborn's mutant plan.<\/p><p>During the \"<a href=\"\/\">Sinister Spider-Man<\/a>\" arc Venom starts a local drug war between two local gang members.

But only three survived the brutal beating, and send some incriminating pictures of \"Spider-Man '' to J.J.J. , but Osborn covers this.

Osborn calls on the <a href=\"..\/..\/sentry\/29-1454\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sentry<\/a> to ambush Thor, and he continues to attack Thor from behind.<\/p><p>Later the real Avengers interfere in the battle and attack Osborn and his troops. Venom is still seen battling and eating Asgardians; Mac knows that Osborn has taken it too far this time and that they will eventually lose but he plans to enjoy it to the very end. As he is consuming Asgardians and stating that they are the Kobe Beef of People, he is interrupted by Spider-man. They fight and Spider-Man almost loses the battle, but Ms. Marvel suddenly arrives on the battlefield and pulls Mac Gargan out of the symbiote. Venom decides to re-assemble with Ms. Marvel; it manages to fully suppress Ms. Marvel and took the full control of her body, but not her mind. Even so, Venom was able to read her brain like an opened book and discovered that Carol has an affection to Peter Parker. Spider-Man tried to use a bell from the church tower but suddenly found out that the bell was removed. Ms. Marvel tried to separate herself from the black suit and told Spider-Man that she needs a powerful energy charge to overcome the symbiote. Spider-Man knocked Venom onto wires and the electricity disconnected Carol from the black suit. Then it came back to it's previous host - Mac Gargan - and tried to attack heroes once more, but Spider-Man webbed Venom's legs and threw him in the air so Ms. Marvel could beat him with car bumper. That's how Venom was sent to a long flight and then crushed into the flying aircraft (probably the A.I.M. one). That was enough to stop him for now. Carol and Spidey decided to come back to the battlefield set up on the ruins of Asgard. Later before the Sentry destroyed Asgard's Venom is seen battling opponents switching from his monstrous size to his Spider-Man size. After the destruction of Asgard by the Void it is unknown what happens to Venom. After <a href=\"\/\">the Void<\/a> is defeated, Mac\/Venom are seen captured along with the rest of the Dark Avengers (except Daken). As Siege ends it is speculated that Venom\/Mac is sent to jail to pay for his crimes.<\/p><h3>Heroic Age<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1671909\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1671909\"><img alt=\"I'm Back!\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg 900w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"I'm Back!\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg 900w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/33913\/1671909-venom003_cvr_col.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>I'm Back!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"..\/..\/mac-gargan\/29-4484\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mac Gargan<\/a> and Venom are taken into The Raft after they are captured during <a href=\"..\/..\/siege\/39-55985\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Siege<\/a>.

Believing that Thompson posed a threat to his ruse, Octavius set out to kill him. Thompson survived their first battle and was able to escape, but the Symbiote was injured by Octavius' advanced weaponry.<\/p><p>Octavius later used his disguise as Peter to lure Flash into a trap, promising that he could give him the ability to walk again. While his machine did indeed give Flash advanced cybernetic legs, it also forcibly separated him from the Symbiote, which quickly grew scared and violent in the absence of its host. Lashing out, it bonded with Octavius, creating a new entity dubbed <strong>Superior Venom<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The Symbiote's influence heightened Octavius' already grandiose sense of self-worth, causing him to arrogantly believe that he could control the Symbiote despite Peter's failure to do so years earlier.

The Symbiote was somehow separated from Thompson, and wandered the streets of New York in search of a new host. It eventually stumbled upon <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/lee-price\/4005-134714\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-134714\">Lee Price<\/a>, a troubled young man, who like Thompson, was a disabled military veteran.<\/p><p>Sensing Price's similarities to Thompson, the Symbiote bonded with him, not realizing that unlike Flash, Lee was a violent and amoral criminal. The resulting merger created a Venom similar to the original Eddie Brock version.<\/p><h3>Agent of the Cosmos<\/h3><p>Eventually, Captain America asked Flash to take Tony Stark's place as a liaison for the Guardians of the Galaxy. Once in space, the symbiote changed its appearance to lose all semblance of body armor while maintaining an exoskeletal appearance and manifesting a jagged mouth. Sensing the symbiote's return to space, the Klyntar hive-mind reached out to it across the cosmos and tried to reconnect to it, causing Flash to lose control of it as it lashed out in rage and confusion, taking on an insectoid appearance when berserk.Seeking to return to Earth, Flash and the symbiote attacked the Guardians but were separated by Peter Quill and Rocket Raccoon. However, the symbiote escaped containment and took over the nearby Groot.<\/p><p>After being separated from Groot by Drax, the symbiote took over Rocket, transforming his arms into bio-mechanical multi-barreled guns and demanding the Guardians turn over their ship to it. When Drax grabbed hold of Rocket, the symbiote immediately transferred over to him, using him to defeat the other Guardians and pilot their ship to its destination: the symbiote homeworld. The symbiote separated from Drax of its own accord, whereupon it was cleansed of its hatred and bloodlust, reintegrated into the Klyntar hivemind, and rebonded to Flash.<\/p><p>After being purged of its bloodlust, the symbiote took on the appearance of bulky body armor with a face markedly resembling that of the Destroyer, though it could still manifest its signature fangs and tongue. After being cleansed, the symbiote developed the ability to hear the \"voice\" of the Cosmos, guiding it to those in need of protection; and the ability to take on humanoid form independently of its host for short periods of time. Together with Flash, the symbiote acted as an Agent of the Cosmos, seeking to restore order across the universe. After being separated from Flash by Gramosian space pirates, the symbiote bonded to their leader, Mercurio, as part of a ploy on Flash's and the symbiote's part in order to buy time for their allies to arrive and to obtain intel on Mercurio's armada. However, the brief period of time the symbiote spent bonded to the warlord undid its cleansing, and the symbiote eventually went berserk, rampaging across the planets it had helped alongside Flash. Seeking to corrupt Flash, it lured him to its first host's homeworld, where it took him over and it attempted to drive him insane with his darkest memories.<\/p><p>With the help of Flash's new allies, the symbiote was subdued and contained, and was taken back to Klyntar to be re-cleansed. Instead, it was placed on trial by the Agents of the Cosmos and nearly executed, but with Flash's help it managed to overcome its bloodlust and learned that its cleansing had failed due to Mania having been corrupted and taken over by the Hell-Mark.<\/p><h3>Return to Earth<\/h3><p>Flash and the Venom symbiote returned to Earth partly to aid Carol Danvers against Tony Stark in the second Civil War, but also to seek out Mania. A spider-bot detected the presence of Flash and the symbiote, tracking them to Philadelphia. Believing the symbiote to be evil and that it had taken over his friend, Peter \u2014 as Spider-Man \u2014 ambushed Venom using anti-symbiote technology developed at Parker Industries. Despite both Flash and the symbiote protesting that they didn't want to fight, Spider-Man separated the symbiote from Flash, preparing to imprison it in his lab. Enraged, the Venom symbiote used its ability to take on humanoid form without a host to catch Peter by surprise and easily overwhelmed him. Trying to lead it away from civilians, Spider-Man quipped that they were old friends due to him being a former host, which to his surprise the symbiote didn't remember. The symbiote prevented Spider-Man from fleeing and bonded to him, but instead of taking over him it showed him memories of its birth and first host, explaining its origins and that the cleanse had purged it of all its memories except those of its original host \u2014 who had corrupted it and left it with an addiction to rage \u2014 and Flash Thompson. The symbiote noted that Peter was teeming with rage towards it, and sincerely apologized for everything it had done to him, stating that it was no longer the Venom he knew and hated. The symbiote released Spider-Man and returned to Flash, who explained that he and the symbiote had returned to Earth to find Mania, Venom's corrupted clone and its prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Accepting that the symbiote had changed for the better, Spider-Man volunteered to help Venom find Mania, and assisted in capturing her before returning to New York.<\/p><p>Andi, corrupted by the Hell-Mark, tried to take both the Mania and Venom symbiotes from Flash, but Venom's allies arrived in time to stop her and suppress the demonic corruption. Some time later the FBI, seeking to return possession of the symbiote to the US Government, hunted Flash down and attacked him with a suit of powered armor equipped with anti-symbiote weaponry, separating him from the symbiote and sending into a feral state. While it regained control of itself, the symbiote did not return to Flash out of shame at enjoying being bloodthirsty and angry.<\/p><p>In search of a new host after being separated from Flash Thompson, the symbiote came across former Army Ranger Lee Price when he was about to be gunned down in a shootout between Tombstone's gang and Black Cat's gang. It bonded to him to protect him and was initially excited to discover he was a soldier, but was quickly horrified when he dominated it with his will and proceeded to massacre both groups of gangs, forcing the memories of his traumatic childhood on it to shut it up when it protested. The symbiote subsequently engaged in a mental argument with Lee, berating him over his actions and callous attitude while accidentally revealing its own sanguine past. Unable to directly control Lee due to his Army Rangers training, the symbiote resigned itself to being bonded to him, but attempted to sabotage his application to Black Cat's gang by causing him to vomit, and tried to refuse to aid him in fighting off the assassin sent by Tombstone to kill him - though when injured by flames it lashed out and killed the assassin.<\/p><p>Two FBI agents soon learned of Venom's new host and tried to force him into becoming an informant by threatening to reveal his identity to the public if he didn't comply, thus risking turning him into a target for law enforcement agencies and vigilantes. When the plan of the FBI agents fell through, Eddie Brock and his anti-symbiotic task force set out to capture him. Spider-Man helped the FBI separate the symbiote from Lee, tricking Venom into thinking he wanted to become its host again. Lee was arrested by the NYPD subsequently while the symbiote was taken to the FBI<\/p><h3>Return of the Lethal Protector<\/h3><p>Before the suit could be handed over to Alpha Flight, Brock broke it free and became Venom once again. However, he was determined to ensure that his relationship to it was different from what it had been when they first bonded. The symbiote's relapse into corruption made this difficult, as it was violently possessive towards him, viciously attacking a priest who it perceived as undermining Eddie's desire to be bonded to it. Knowing that the symbiote had recently been heroic and wanting to understand why it was relapsing into its predatory corrupted state, Eddie sought the help of Alchemax, and learned that his body had been rendered nearly inhospitable to symbiotes a result of being saturated with symbiote suppressant drugs during his time with the FBI. Alchemax decided to help Eddie if he brought Stegron to them along with the equipment he stole. Doing so, they gave him a medicine that would rebalance Eddie's metabolism so his body wouldn't reject the Klyntar.<\/p><p>Together, they arrested criminals and the symbiote felt good to be a hero again. However, it took too much out of its host's body sometimes making Eddie sleep longer so it can think while watching TV, and subconsciously influencing Eddie in order to fight criminals. The symbiote was concerned at feeling emotions contradictory to those of its host, such as feeling joy in contrast to Eddie's anger when he was unable to sell the television. With the effects of its cleansing ending, the symbiote was able to remember its previous hosts and the influences they'd had on it while lamenting at having been separated from Flash. In its quest for redemption for everything it had done through the years, it payed a visit to the priest it have previously attacked, asking for forgiveness. After a brief conversation, the symbiote realized why Eddie had talked to the priest and it was happy he hadn't died, promising him its protection.<\/p><p>A little after, they were summoned to an alternate universe by Venomized versions of Captain America and Doctor Strange to help in a multiversal war against the Poisons, an extra-dimensional alien race that permanently bond with symbiotes, consuming their hosts' bodies to complete the bonding process and also assimilate their powers. At the last moments, the Venomized Doctor Strange sent the remaining Venoms back home before the Poisons' ship exploded.<\/p><p>After returning home, the symbiote's growing corruption renewed its bloodlust, causing it to frequently relapse into its feral, villainous state despite Eddie's efforts to satiate its hunger without resorting to murder or cannibalism. After it attempted to devour a corrupt cop, Kraven the Hunter, and the Ringer, Eddie finally became fed up and returned to Alchemax to demand an explanation as to the diminishing effectiveness of the cure. Flash Thompson intervened and demanded Eddie return the symbiote to him, and the symbiote tried to bond to both of its favorite hosts at once. Spider-Man intervened in an attempt to kill it and overturned a vat of serum derived from the Anti-Venom symbiote (which caused the symbiote to be cured from its re-corruption and made Eddie's metabolism return to normal), thus the symbiote biomass bonded to Flash was converted into an artificial replica of the Anti-Venom symbiote, which he used to forcibly extract the Venom symbiote from Eddie. Despite being unable to rebond to Flash due to the Anti-Venom, the symbiote was nevertheless happy to reunite with its old host, and was left in Bobbi Morse's bathroom for safekeeping while Spider-Man and Anti-Venom went looking for Lee Price, who had attacked Mania and stolen her symbiote. The symbiote eventually decided to escape and destroyed the bathroom before noticing a shard of glass fall down the drain. Escaping into the sewers in search of Eddie, it scared a couple of city workers before finally finding and rebonding with Eddie, who had met up with Black Cat.<\/p><p>Venom and Black Cat searched for Dr. Steve so they could weaponize the Anti-Venom serum, using it to free Spider-Man - who had been infected by the Maniac symbiote. Venom reluctantly teamed up with Spider-Man, Agent Anti-Venom, and Andi Benton - who had come to New York to help Flash and reclaim her symbiote, still going by the alias as Mania using her hellish powers. The six decided to face Maniac, who had infected the Five Families with his symbiote. Using the Anti-Venom serum and the replica of the Anti-Venom used by Flash Thompson, they defeated the Inklings. However, the small pieces infecting everyone returned to Maniac, who absorbed them to assume a massive form and attempted to forcibly assimilate the Venom symbiote by eating Eddie. However, Spider-Man and Black Cat figured out that they were immune to the Maniac symbiote since they were previously possessed by it. Spider-Man made the Anti-Venom symbiote absorb his blood with the \"Anti-Maniac\" properties, thus allowing its immunity to take down Maniac and revert the symbiote to its original mass and size, though it would still be bounded with Lee Price. After Price was arrested, Flash finally came to the conclusion that the Venom symbiote was safe with Eddie Brock and brokered an uneasy truce between Spider-Man and Venom.<\/p><p>With Eddie's altered metabolism having been cured by being doused in the Anti-Venom serum, the symbiote was able to recover from its physical and psychological instability, returning to the benevolent state it had been in as an Agent of the Cosmos. When Spider-Woman attacked Eddie, the symbiote temporarily bonded to her to convince her they were turning over a new leaf and revealed that it was about to give birth again - though it chose to keep this a secret from Eddie.<\/p><h3>The Poisons Strike Back<\/h3><p>When the time-displaced X-Men approached Venom and asked for his assistance, their allies the Starjammers having been captured by symbiote-clad bounty hunters, the Venom symbiote tried to persuade an unwilling Eddie to help them. When Eddie obstinately refused to listen to it, the symbiote knocked him out and allowed the Young X-Men to capture them and take them into space. When Eddie regained consciousness, the symbiote persuaded him to help them after hearing that the bounty-hunters had been using their symbiotes as weapons - having been traumatized by the events of the war against the Poisons. The symbiote was confused when Haze Mancer - who had sold symbiotes to the bounty hunters - recognized it, not remembering him. It recognized Killer Thrill and informed the Young X-Men of her powers through Eddie, and was horrified to discover the Poisons had infiltrated Earth-616, lamenting the loss of several of its brethren and that it was only a matter of time before the Poisons pursued it to Earth. The symbiote subsequently aided Eddie in defeating the Poisons, destroying the Hive, and returning its captured brethren to Klyntar.<\/p><p><b>The Seventh Spawn of Venom<\/b><\/p><p>As the time for it to give birth drew closer, the Venom symbiote began to go out of its way to protect its unborn spawn, even if it meant endangering Eddie in the process. Not telling him out of fear that its soon-to-be-born spawn would turn out to be a monster like its others had, the symbiote was almost captured by the FBI's Symbiote Task Force, which wanted to claim the spawn and bond it to Mac Gargan. While the symbiote keeping secrets had formed a rift of distrust between it and Eddie, he took it to Alchemax so Dr. Steve could assist in it giving birth - the labor being longer and more difficult than its previous spawns'. The symbiote agreed to leave its offspring in Dr. Steve's custody until it and Eddie decided the offspring was ready to take a host.<\/p><p>When Norman Osborn bonded to the Carnage symbiote to become the Red Goblin, Eddie was blackmailed by J. Jonah Jameson into protecting Mary Jane. Despite teaming up with Spider-Man, Venom was outmatched and only barely managed to fend the Red Goblin off. Exhausted, Eddie decided to lend the symbiote to Spider-Man - giving him a much-needed power boost. Peter reluctantly agreed and the symbiote bonded to him, making him powerful enough to fight toe-to-toe with the Red Goblin. When Flash Thompson was mortally wounded, Symbiote Spider-Man went berserk and Venomized, though Flash managed to calm him down so as to keep the symbiote from being re-corrupted by Peter's rage. As part of a gambit to separate Osborn from the Carnage symbiote, Spider-Man separated from the Venom symbiote and sent it back to Eddie, assuring it that he would be fine when it expressed concern for his safety. After reuniting with Eddie, the symbiote attended Flash's funeral in the shape of a tuxedo.<\/p><p>Shortly afterward, Tel-Kar came to Earth looking for the symbiote, which prompted Eddie to rescue him from the Skrull Warbride M'lanz. The symbiote subsequently regained its memories of Tel-Kar, who asked it to leave Eddie and re-bond with him; but when it refused he blackmailed it into bonding to him by threatening to corrupt its spawn, the Sleeper symbiote. Tel-Kar dominated the Venom symbiote, suppressing its consciousness and using it to attack a Skrull military installation containing a species-annihilating bio-weapon, but it broke free of his control when he attempted to kill Eddie and its offspring. Tel-Kar forced the symbiote off himself and it rebonded to Eddie, while Sleeper latched on to M'lanz to protect her from the bio-weapon. Venom returned to Earth, severing ties with Alchemax, and when Tel-Kar attacked, the symbiote was disabled protecting its offspring, upon recovering it learned that the Sleeper symbiote had bonded to and lobotomized Tel-Kar before setting off to explore the cosmos.<\/p><h3>Battle with the Symbiote God and Abandoning Eddie<\/h3><p>Some time later, the symbiote began to suffer nightmares of an ancient and powerful evil deity that had been worshiped by the symbiotes in the ancient past. As the symbiote god's influence over it intensified, the Venom symbiote was inflicted with increasingly frequent and intense bouts of insanity and bloodlust. This prompted Eddie to suppress it with anti-psychosis medication and refrain from combat out of fear it would attack innocents, spending several months attempting to figure out what was wrong with it. In the thrall of the symbiote god, the Venom symbiote went berserk and attempted to kill a Jack O'Lantern impersonator and a pair of policemen, but was subdued by Rex Strickland - a former member of a team of symbiote-enhanced super-soldiers. Returned to lucidity, the symbiote helped Eddie attempt to rescue Strickland's former comrades, but was controlled by the symbiote god and forced to separate from him. When Eddie was mortally wounded by one of the controlled super-soldiers, the symbiote snapped out of its stupor and healed him, attempting to explain what was going on as a symbiote-dragon devoured the super-soldier's symbiotes and went on a rampage.<\/p><p>When Eddie confronted Rex over what had happened, the symbiote succumbed to the dark god's control and attacked, though Eddie was able to subdue it with the flames from Rex's blast furnace. When the new Spider-Man, Miles Morales, attacked, having mistaken Eddie for the Venom that had killed his mother, the symbiote went berserk and nearly killed him before being subdued by a Venom Blast. After the symbiote dragon was defeated by Morales' Venom Blast and Knull - the dark god of the symbiotes - manifested, the symbiote initially submitted itself to him before Eddie's rage over Knull casually killing innocents sent it into a berserk rage. Knull subsequently stripped it from Eddie and attempted to connect it to his hive mind, turning its eyespots red; but it returned to Eddie after Knull was attacked by Morales. Restored to lucidity and with new powers as a result of its brief connection to Knull, the Venom symbiote informed him that Rex was actually the last piece of the symbiote-dragon, merging with him so as to become powerful enough to fight Knull. Despite being armed with an arsenal of high-power weapons, the Venom and Tyrannosaurus symbiotes were stripped from Eddie and absorbed into the Grendel symbiote, though Eddie detonated said arsenal. Shielded from the blast by the Tyrannosaurus symbiote, the Venom symbiote returned to Eddie. When the Tyrannosaurus symbiote sacrificed itself to drag Knull's avatar into the blast furnace, Eddie sustaining severe burns while holding the door shut. The Venom symbiote was overwhelmed by the intense heat and strain of keeping him alive, and seemingly perished while telling Eddie it loved him.<\/p><p>The Venom symbiote survived, seizing control of an unconscious Eddie when he was discovered by Project Oversight and rampaging for three weeks. Recognizing Dylan Brock as Eddie's son and fearing that learning this would cause him to abandon it, the symbiote pretended to be brain dead and began suppressing various memories it sensed would be harmful to him; leading to Eddie not remembering the Maker's repeated attempts to interrogate him over a period of two weeks and forgetting Flash Thompson's death.<\/p><p>When the Maker revealed that he had extracted a codex - trace remnants of symbiote biomass left in former hosts - from a sample of Flash's blood, and that he intended to exhume and vivisect Flash's corpse in order to extract more; the Venom symbiote went berserk and attacked him. Separating from Eddie in order to restrain the Maker, the symbiote stuffed him in a morgue locker and stole Flash's codex. When they were attacked by guards wielding sonic weapons, the symbiote absorbed the codex and channeled Flash's personality imprint within it, filling the void of its lost awareness; transforming Eddie into Agent Venom. However, the codex eventually burnt out and the symbiote returned to its mindless state.<\/p><p>When Eddie traveled to San Francisco to try to reconcile with his father, the symbiote took on the form of a dog. Eddie's reunion with his father ended disastrously, with Carl saying they never were a family and punching Eddie in the face. This enraged the symbiote, which tried to devour him; but Eddie managed to restrain it and ran away. When a pair of homeless men attempted to break into Eddie's motel room, symbiote discovered that Carnage had returned more powerful than ever, and had taken over the Underground City that Venom had once protected. Believing himself to be Eddie's younger half-brother, Dylan tried to get Eddie's help to kill their physically-abusive father.<sup>[163]<\/sup> Eddie agreed to make sure the abuse stopped, but he passed out after a vision of Knull, vomiting blood. After Eddie was taken to the hospital, the Venom symbiote put him into a comatose state, cocooning his body.<sup>[164]<\/sup> Engaging in a mental confrontation with Eddie, the symbiote posed as Mary Brock, Eddie's uncle, and his father in an attempt to get Eddie to fully embrace it. However, Eddie was able to see through its deceptions and was outraged that it would trick and lie him after everything they had been through following their reunion. Rejected by Eddie and separated from him by the Maker, the symbiote incapacitated the evil Reed Richards and used its power to take on an humanoid form without a host to rescue Dylan. Impersonating Eddie to berate Carl Brock in a mental confrontation, the symbiote left him in the desert before taking Dylan to Eddie. Apologizing for what it had done, the symbiote said that both Eddie and Dylan would be better off without it before departing from their lives.<\/p><p>Alerted to the suffering of another member of its species at the hands of Kulan Gath- who had captured, imprisoned, and tortured it in order to serve as bait, the Venom symbiote arrived to help Logan, the Punisher, Elektra, and Doctor Voodoo fight the eldritch god JhoatunLau. Exposure to the Jhoatun Lau's cosmic radiation caused the Venom symbiote to take on the form of a massive dragon similar to the Grendel, letting it hold its own against Jhoatun Lau in combat. Angered after noticing that Conan had bonded to the enslaved symbiote, Venom demanded that he relinquish its dying brethren and got even more angry when he refused. Before they could come to blows, Elektra intervened and proposed they work together until they could vanquish the Marrow God. After Jhoatun's death, it reverted to it's original form and both it and Conan helped Wolverine to damage the god's skull in order to permanently kill it. The assembled team gone to stop Kulan Gath plans, eventually leading to it's brethren's death and forced the cult to retreat.<\/p><p>Still without a host, the Venom symbiote was recruited by Captain Marvel into her War Avengers strike force alongside Deadpool, Weapon H, Sif, Winter Soldier, and Captain Britain. Sent into battle against Malekith himself in London, Venom immediately attempted to eat the dark elf warlord but was subdued using the Ebony Blade. Captured and taken to Stonehenge, the Venom symbiote was tortured by Malekith in an attempt to bend it to his will despite its efforts to resist. After Malekith realized the Black Bifrost had been captured, he bent the symbiote to his will and used it to badly wound All-Mother Freyja; wielding it as a Necrosword in emulation of All-Black. Bonding to the symbiote and dubbing himself the \"Butcher of Thors\" in emulation of Knull and Gorr the God Butcher, Malekith attempted to use the magic-enhanced \"Venom Blade\/Symbio Sword\" to kill Thor Odinson, All-Father Thor, Young Thor, and Thor (Jane Foster). The symbiote was ultimately separated from Malekith by Thor, and left to begin preparing for Carnage's imminent attack.<\/p><h3>Absolute Carnage<\/h3><p>Locating Eddie and Dylan in Manhattan, the Venom symbiote rebonded to Eddie to protect him when Cletus pushed them in front of an oncoming subway train. While Eddie was initially reluctant to reunite with it, Cletus transformed into Dark Carnage - a towering skeletal monster - and easily overpowered them. After Eddie escaped by electrocuting Kasady with the subway's third rail, the symbiote put him in a coma so that it could heal him while taking over his body, then walked with Dylan to Peter Parker's apartment before returning control to Eddie.<\/p><p>The symbiote urged Eddie to set aside his jealousy and anger, and to work together with Spider-Man in order to stop Dark Carnage. When Spider-Man and Venom entered Ravencroft to prevent Dark Carnage from getting Norman Osborn's Carnage codex, John Jameson - who had been infected by the Grendel symbiote - fell under Carnage's control and set off the alarm, incapacitating the Venom symbiote until Eddie shot out the PA system. Before it could fully recover from the sonic attack, the Venom symbiote sensed Dark Carnage infecting the inmates with the Grendel symbiote and began screaming in terror inside Eddie's head. When Dark Carnage threw Spider-Man through Norman Osborn's cell door, Venom incapacitated Osborn - who believed himself to be Cletus Kasady - and barricaded the door using the symbiote. However, Dark Carnage easily kicked him out of the way and bonded Osborn to part of the Grendel symbiote to turn him into Carnage again.<\/p><p>After escaping by using the Venom symbiote's ability to create wings, Venom set out to warn the super villains and antiheroes who had bonded to symbiotes in the past, coming across Mac Gargan and Miles Morales fighting against a horde of Carnage Doppelgangers. When Norman Osborn attacked, crippling Gargan and bonding Miles to a portion of the Grendel symbiote, the Venom symbiote speared Osborn through the chest and demanded that Eddie kill him and Miles, while threatening to abandon him for a stronger host if he didn't find the resolve to do what was needed to end the war. After rescuing Gargan and returning to Rex's warehouse, the symbiote asked Eddie to tell Spider-Man the full story regarding the symbiotes' presence on Earth in order to end his persecution complex, and was annoyed when he refused to do so. When Dark Carnage attacked, the symbiote angrily abandoned Eddie when he tried to retreat to protect Dylan and bonded to Bruce Banner, who transformed into the Devil Hulk after being killed by Dark Carnage.<\/p><p>The Venomized Hulk put up an even fight against Dark Carnage, who sensed the power of the One Below All and wanted to merge its power with Knull's. When the Venomized Hulk refused to join him, Dark Carnage stabbed tendrils into his brain to force him to revert into Bruce Banner, then ripped the Venom symbiote off of him and assimilated it - causing Dark Carnage to transform itself into an even more powerful form sporting draconic wings, horns, pauldrons, and arm wraps resembling those of Knull.<\/p><p>After Eddie - who had bonded to the codices extracted by the Maker's machine - killed Dark Carnage with a Necrosword manifested from his gestalt symbiote, the Venom symbiote returned to him and assimilated the Grendel symbiote. Sensing Knull's awakening through its connection to the hive mind, the Venom symbiote berated him for having doomed the universe, but remained bonded to him.<\/p><h3>Venom Island and Beyond<\/h3><p>A few weeks later, Eddie received an invitation to join the Avengers, with the Venom symbiote trying to calm him down and assuage his lack of self-worth. It was interrupted by the Grendel symbiote - which had been imprinted with the personality of the original Carnage symbiote, and soon threatened to take over Eddie and force him to kill the Avengers. Silencing both symbiotes with antipsychotic medication, Eddie chartered a Quinjet to the Isla de Huesos, but the Carnage symbiote awakened and crashed the plane. Stripping the Venom symbiote off Eddie, the Carnage symbiote assimilated it - leaving it unable to do anything except watch as it hunted Eddie across the island in an attempt to take him over. When Dylan tapped into the symbiote hive-mind in order to commune with Knull, the Venom symbiote sensed him and tried to ask him to get help. The Venom symbiote was separated from Carnage when it was struck by lightning while bonding to Eddie, and attempted to rebond to him before the Carnage symbiote could do so. The Carnage symbiote bonded to Eddie first, forcing the Venom symbiote to flee into the jungle. Contacted by Dylan, who had immersed himself into the Symbiote Hive-Mind, the Venom symbiote allowed him to remote-pilot it and took on the form of a <i>Tyrannosaurus rex<\/i> to oppose Carnage.<\/p><p>This didn't prove to be enough, as Carnage still got the upper hand, physically and mentally, as Dylan tried to contact his father through the symbiote Hive-Mind. Eddie was imprisoned in a mental Klyntar, so Dylan tried to free him but was imprisoned himself since Carnage was able to control the piece Dylan kept of it. With Eddie's encouragement, both he and his son overcame Carnage's will, with Eddie separating from it and destroying the piece it was controlling. Venom rebonded to Eddie and escaped the isle just in time to warn the Avengers about Knull. After this, they were suddenly attacked by Virus, which left them to question who he might be.<\/p><p>Eddie and Dylan met the Maker at his warehouse to question him about Dylan's powers. The Maker simply revealed his plans to study the symbiotes in order to upgrade his world's Venom symbiote to return to his home dimension. The Venom Symbiote was frightened by this revelation and how it and Dylan couldn't feel it because of it's synthetic origin, but their conversation was interrupted by an alarm that revealed something was invading the warehouse. As the Maker bid them farewell and good luck in their fight against Knull, Virus appeared and unintentionally destroyed the Maker's portal while attacking. They were all sucked in, and while the Maker returned to his home world, the rest of them were transported to Earth-1051 - a reality where Earth had been conquered by symbiotes. Virus viciously attacked Venom, but has the symbiote connected itself to that world's Hive-Mind, it gained new abilities, and was able to redirect one of Virus' energy blasts. When Eddie returned to Dylan, Eddie was surprised to see that world's Avengers.<\/p><p>He tried to convince them he wasn't an enemy, but Captain America insisted for him to separate from the Venom symbiote. As it was about to start a fight, Virus attacked Eddie, only to be arrested by the Avengers because of his anti-symbiote tech. Eddie and Dylan got away and followed their way into the sewers, were they meet five versions of the Agent Venom. Believing one of them to be Flash Thompson, Eddie revealed his identity and that Agent Venom revealed to be that world's Anne Weying. Anne revealed that her son Dylan, now dubbing himself Codex, was the leader of the Hive and that her Eddie Brock had killed himself in that world, thus she became Venom instead of him. After Virus attacked their base, now empowered by the Scorpion symbiote, Dylan used his powers to kill it, revealing his identity as Mac Gargan. Eddie decided to use him to get to Codex and fuse both Dylan's memories, hoping it would revert Codex back to normal. Their plan worked, putting that world's Dylan in a coma state. After that, that world has returned to normality and Virus was arrested. The Venom symbiote spent over a year on Earth-1051 with Eddie and his family, and arrived back to Earth-616 just in time to Knull's arrival.<\/p><h3>Second Symbiote Invasion<\/h3><p>In case the Avengers' initial plan to defeat Knull failed, Eddie and the Venom symbiote came up with a two-part follow-up plan that involved using Thor, Storm, and the Sentry to sever as many symbiote-dragons from Knull's hive-mind as possible, and Venom would use Dark Carnage's throne of living abyss to seize control of them. However, this plan immediately went awry due to Thor being MIA and Knull easily overpowering and killing the Sentry. Deciding to buy Earth some time by giving Knull what he wanted, Venom surrendered and offered to serve Knull in exchange for the Earth being spared. Knull rejected this proposal, instead ripping the Venom symbiote from Eddie and declaring his intent to go after Dylan next. Venom begged Knull to let it save Eddie, but Knull absorbed it into his symbiote-armor and all-but extinguished its indivduality. After Eddie's death, his consciousness was preserved within the Hive-Mind as a codex, and with help from the codices of Rex Strickland and Flash Thompson he infiltrated the core of the Hive-Mind. When Flash was reborn as a symbiote-dragon, Knull confronted Eddie's codex within the core of the Hive-Mind and attempted to destroy him, but the Venom symbiote broke free from Knull's control and reunited with Eddie.<\/p><p>Piloted by Eddie's codex, the Venom symbiote was reborn through the living abyss of the symbiote dragons and assumed the form of a giant, attempting to attack Knull directly. However, the God of Light ripped Eddie's consciousness out of the Venom symbiote and resurrected his body - the Venom symbiote dissipating but promising Eddie it would find him. After Knull's defeat, the God of Light left Eddie and the Venom symbiote rebonded to him, explaining that as the one who vanquished Knull he was now the new God of the Symbiotes.<\/p><h3>Father-Son Bonding Time<\/h3><p>The Venom symbiote moved into a house purchased by Tony Stark alongside Eddie, Dylan, and Sleeper. However, over the next few months Eddie began to rapidly age due to the strain being the King in Black placed on his still-mortal body. Upon discovering Dylan had been getting into fights at school, Eddie tasked the Venom symbiote with keeping an eye on him, and it seperated from him and once again took on the form of a dog to do so. En route to Midtown High School, Dylan asked the Venom symbiote what its true name was, the symbiote explaining that its kind didn't have names as humans understood them so much as unique emotional wavelengths.<\/p><p>While walking back to the Brock residence - Dylan once again having wound up in detention, they noticed Jack O'Lantern mugging an old woman and intervened. The Venom symbiote attempted to frighten Jack O'Lantern away in order to protect Dylan, but this resulted in Dylan being shot in the chest. Out of desperation, the Venom symbiote bonded to Dylan and they beat up Jack O'Lantern together. Shortly afterwards, Eddie revealed he had anticipated something like this occurring. While skeptical of the changes Dylan had made to Venom's appearance, Eddie gave Dylan his blessing to act as Venom and asked his old friend to watch over his son, before informing Dylan of a Goblin sighting.<\/p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1693262\" data-ratio=\"1.1670843776107\" data-width=\"1197\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1197px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1693262\"><img alt=\"The symbiote is able to mimic clothing.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\" data-width=\"548\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg 1197w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg 548w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The symbiote is able to mimic clothing.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg 1197w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/78897\/1693262-venom_._amazing_spider_man_375_i.jpg 548w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\" data-width=\"548\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The symbiote is able to mimic clothing.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Symbiotes empower the natural abilities of a host to the point where they far exceed that of normal members of the hosts' species. These abilities include the following: superhuman strength (retains the strength from previous host), speed and agility, Super enhanced durability, resistance to damage and healing ability, genetic memory, recalling information from previous hosts. Can expand to any size as long as they have something to grow on such as a host or an object. Symbiotes can get inside of small areas such as electric wires and the insides of cars and completely disable them. The Symbiote also reacts to the thoughts and will of the host. When Spider-Man was originally selected, he had been thinking about Arachne's costume. The Symbiote acted on this and formed a similar costume, the one seen on him and Venom. The Symbiote can sense the presence of other Symbiote within a certain distance. The symbiote also has the ability to shapeshift such as mimicking clothing, and the complete and utter change of appearance and stature of its host.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/51666\/1046376-venom2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1046376\" data-ratio=\"1.3666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/51666\/1046376-venom2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1046376\"><img alt=\"The symbiote has the ability to create webbing from its own mass.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/5\/51666\/1046376-venom2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/5\/51666\/1046376-venom2.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The symbiote has the ability to create webbing from its own mass.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/5\/51666\/1046376-venom2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/5\/51666\/1046376-venom2.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The symbiote has the ability to create webbing from its own mass.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Venom Symbiote has also adapted the spider-powers of Spider-Man, and those same powers have also been inherited by its offspring such as the ability to cling onto walls and produce an infinite amount of webbing from its own mass along with the ability to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense. At his peak, before coming into contact with the symbiote, Brock can lift (press) 700 lbs. As Venom, Brock's strength allows him to lift (press) 25 tons which is stronger than Spider-Man himself (before having the Anti-Venom Symbiote which allowed him to lift 100 tons). Gargan can lift twice than Spider-Man, he originally could lift (press) 25 tons. The natural super-strength of Gargan, combined with the strength of the symbiote, allows him to lift (press) over 100 tons.<\/p><p>The Symbiote also allows the user shape-shifting abilities. Norman provided Gargan a certain-type of medicine that allows the symbiote to return to its original form to mimic Spider-Man's appearance. The medicine must be taken in between periods of times, or else the symbiote would take over Gargan. Gargan has the ability to switch between the Venom appearance and the smaller Spider-Man appearance. Additionally, the symbiote is capable of healing injuries in the host at a faster rate than normal human healing allows. The symbiote is also capable of healing injuries and illnesses that current human medical care cannot such as cancer. The symbiote can also steal the powers and abilities of other beings, and it has been recently discovered that the symbiote can recall and mimic the powers and abilities of previous hosts.<\/p><h3>Weaknesses<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-664868\" data-ratio=\"0.94444444444444\" data-width=\"2592\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2592px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-664868\"><img alt=\"The symbiote contained using sonics, one of its known weaknesses.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg 2592w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The symbiote contained using sonics, one of its known weaknesses.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg 2592w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11136\/664868-venom_contained.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The symbiote contained using sonics, one of its known weaknesses.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Venom symbiote, like almost all symbiotes, is highly vulnerable to sonics and intense heat.

The next few days sees Castle continuing his crusade against crime as usual, with a little \"help\" from the symbiote. After wasting the Kingpin and other rival crime-lords, the Punisher's fellow crime-fighters become concerned. They stage an intervention and confront Castle. An internal struggle ensues between Castle and the symbiote within the Punisher's mind. Eventually, by sheer force of will, Castle wins and regains control.

Peter was surprised under the mask and told Eddie that they all ready had a guy, Eddie replied with some insults to peter saying that his pictures make Spider-Man look chunky and that he was an armature.<\/p><p>And then Eddie went to the Daily Bugle to sell some Spidey pictures to <a href=\"..\/..\/j-jonah-jameson\/29-1487\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">J. Jonah Jameson.<\/a> Eddie got held up at the front desk laying some pick-up lines on Jonahs secretary till he got the chance to slide into Jonah's office. Jonah didn't even know who Eddie was and until another member of his staff had reminded Jonah that he hired Eddie . Eddie introduced himself and tried to sell his pictures till peter bust on the scene and tried to sell his pictures of Spidey. once again Eddie insulted Peter's pictures saying that photography isn't all about \"flag poles\". So Eddie and Pete each tried to convince Jonah to buy there pictures but Jonah decided to go with Eddie's picture since they were cheaper and Eddie complimented on Jonah's shirt. Then Eddie said some sob things to get a staff job. Peter immediately struck back saying he deserved the staff spot more. Jonah couldn't decide so set peter and Eddie on a mission, who ever got the picture of Spider-Man with \"his hand in the cookie jar\" would get the staff job. The two headed out to get the picture.<\/p><p>Peter had gotten sucked into the symbiote and had on his black suit when he went to go fight the <a href=\"..\/..\/sandman\/29-3544\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sandman.<\/a> Eddie showed up and took pictures of black suit Spidey to complete the mission Jonah sent him and Pete off to do. Eddie got the pictures but in the black suit Spider-Man was more cocky and \"evil\" so to speak and threw eddies camera into a wall destroying the pictures he took of black suit Spidey. Eddie complained but then took out a digital camera and took pictures of some things and then cheated to get the staff job by taking a picture of Spider-Man and turning it black putting a money bag in spider-mans hand and had him slinging away from a bank. Peter knew that the pictures were fake and edited by Eddie so then went to the Daily Bugle and interrupted eddies celebration on getting the staff job and put Eddie up against a wall telling him he knew they were fake pictures. Eddie begged peter not to tell anyone but peter didn't listen and told the staff and proved that the picture was edited, Eddie was immediately fired by Jonah.<\/p><p>Later in the film, Eddie was so mad about Peter taking away his reputation that he went to the church to beg god to kill Peter Parker. While Eddie was at the church he heard someone screaming so went to check it out. it was Peter ripping off the symbiote suit, some of the symbiote got on Eddie and took over his body turning him into the dreaded <a href=\"\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/6381293-venom%20film.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6381293\" data-ratio=\"0.41\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:41.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/6381293-venom%20film.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6381293\"><img alt=\"Eddie as Venom \" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-width=\"700\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/6381293-venom%20film.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/6381293-venom%20film.jpg 700w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/6381293-venom%20film.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Eddie as Venom \" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/6381293-venom%20film.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/6381293-venom%20film.jpg 700w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/6381293-venom%20film.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-width=\"700\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Eddie as Venom <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>He later roams the streets of <a href=\"..\/..\/new-york-city\/34-41183\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">New York<\/a> and gets attacked by Sandman who thinks he is Spider-Man.

Eddie is next seen on a bench wondering how he managed to stay alive. The suit quickly takes control and begins eating a bunch of people in Central Park. <a href=\"..\/..\/silver-sable\/29-7608\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Silver Sable<\/a> and the <a href=\"..\/..\/wild-pack\/65-11879\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Wild Pack<\/a> try to capture Venom but fail. Eddie is voiced by Daniel Capallaro, while Venom is voiced by Arthur Burghardt.<\/p><p>The next day, Venom attacks an art museum and confronts Spider-Man. Before they do any serious fighting, Silver Sable shows up and shoots Venom with with some kind of neutralizing agent which knocks Eddie unconscious, allowing them to successfully capture him. Eddie is next seen in a containment facility owned by Trask Industries. The owner, <a href=\"\/bolivar-trask\/4005-15923\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15923\">Bolivar Trask<\/a>, states that since they own the suit they wish to test it. When Eddie says that it is to much to control, Trask says that hey will find someone else to test it if he dies. If he is left to long in there without food, then the suit will consume Eddie until there is nothing left. Eddie gives in and agrees to help them test the suit.<\/p><p>His first mission is to break a prisoner out of <a href=\"..\/..\/rykers-island\/34-55830\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ryker's Island<\/a>, namely <a href=\"..\/..\/electro\/29-3228\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Electro<\/a>. He completes this task with ease. His next mission is to fight him, since the suit shows a weakness to electricity. However, as Venom and Electro start fighting, Spider-Man shows up and starts taunting Electro. However he was then knocked unconscious by a bolt of lightning. Venom didn't want Spider-Man to be killed though he wanted to kill Spider-Man himself. So as he fought Electro, he also had to protect Spider-Man. After he him up, he turned towards Spider-Man and was about to kill him to when S.H.I.E.L.D. agents surrounded him. Realizing that killing Spider-Man would have to wait, Venom fled. Even thought the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents followed him, he managed to get away.<\/p><p>Back at Trask Industries, Eddie explains that whenever he is around Spider-Man, the suit feels more control, and that that makes him feel good. Eddie then exposes Peter Parker as Spider-Man. Trask decides to kidnap Peter, so he can help Eddie get more control over the suit. While captive, a scientist injected Peter with part of the suit. This gave Peter his own suit, which in the game has been called <a href=\"..\/..\/carnage\/29-1490\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Carnage<\/a> (not the same Carnage as in the comics though, this was its own entity). Carnage escaped, and quickly found Eddie. Venom and Carnage brawled for a while, until Venom grabbed the tired Carnage and ate the suit. A now scared Peter asked Eddie what was going on. Venom answered, \"I have absolute, total, control!\" Venom decided to settle the score with Trask when Venom was about to go after Trask at his office Spider-Man kicks him out of the window then Trask tries to escape by helicopter, problem is he doesn't know how to fly the helicopter! and sitting inside it while at the mercy of a vengeful Eddie Brock. He tries to push the helicopter off the Trask building with Trask inside intending to let him fall to his death but Spider-Man was able to stop him and take Eddie down for the count, unfortunately he managed to escape without peter noticing before S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives at the scene. Shortly after his battle with Spidey, Trask was taken to a state prison off the coast of the city and was sentenced to spend his time there for 3 years Eddie appears before him and presumably kills him when he was alone, He remains at large and whether he and Peter will encounter each is unknown.<\/p><h4><strong>Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects<\/strong><\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7365228\" data-ratio=\"0.43949579831933\" data-width=\"1190\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1190px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:43.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7365228\"><img alt=\"Venom in Marvel Nemesis\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg 1190w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Venom in Marvel Nemesis\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg 1190w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/7365228-venom%20nemesis.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Venom in Marvel Nemesis<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Venom appears as one of the playable characters in the game, with Jason Bryden providing his voice.<\/p><h4><strong>Marvel Ultimate Alliance<\/strong><\/h4><p>Venom is a DLC character in the villains pack along with <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-doom\/29-1468\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Doctor Doom<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/magneto\/29-1441\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Magneto<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/sabretooth\/29-4563\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sabretooth<\/a>.

His mother encouraged the young Otto, already a good student, to push himself in school, in the hopes that he would have a better life than his factory worker father. Otto was awarded a <a href=\"#\" rel=\"nofollow \">scholarship<\/a> for university, shortly before his father died in a workplace accident. Becoming obsessed with schoolwork after his father's death, Otto applied himself even harder to his studies in science. He graduated and got work with an engineering firm, soon becoming a respected nuclear physicist and research consultant, as well as working as an inventor and lecturer. He soon developed a remarkable invention- <a href=\"\/doctor-octopus-arms\/4055-50692\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50692\">a chest harness that connected the wearer to four mechanical arms<\/a>. This invention earned him a new nickname: Doctor Octopus. Around this time, he became involved with a fellow researcher, <a href=\"\/mary-alice-anders\/4005-16124\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16124\">Mary Alice Anders<\/a>, to whom he eventually proposed marriage. However, the happy couple was broken up by Otto's mother, who disapproved of the young bride-to-be. Otto broke off the engagement at his mother's behest, but she died soon after in the middle of an argument with her son. Having lost all of his social ties, Otto became more withdrawn and sullen, and grew obsessively dedicated to his work while simultaneously throwing professional and operational caution to the wind. This recklessness with his personal safety lead directly to an accident that would change his life forever. A radiation leak in the lab caused an explosion, which fused the harness and limbs onto his body. The radiation simultaneously caused mutations in his brain, allowing him to have direct control over the arms through telepathy. Driven insane by the accident and the damage it had caused to his body and mind, Doctor Octopus became dedicated to a life of crime.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Doctor Octopus was created by <a href=\"\/stan-lee\/4040-40467\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee<\/a> and <a href=\"\/steve-ditko\/4040-4026\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko<\/a>.

Later stories hinted that he may have possessed low-level telepathy from a young age, which was in turn implied to have caused a brain aneurysm in his father.<\/p><p>He briefly abandoned the Doctor Octopus identity, creating the identity of the \"Master Planner,\" a criminal mastermind, to orchestrate his plots. However, he eventually resumed the Doctor Octopus identity.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Sinister Six<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2246453\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2246453-panel_asmann001b.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.99548532731377\" data-width=\"443\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 443px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2246453-panel_asmann001b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2246453\"><img alt=\"Formation of the Six\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/79709\/2246453-panel_asmann001b.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2246453-panel_asmann001b.jpg 443w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/79709\/2246453-panel_asmann001b.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Formation of the Six<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Doctor Octopus is the impetus for the formation of the original <a href=\"\/sinister-six\/4060-40429\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40429\">Sinister Six<\/a>, which occurs following a series of defeats at the hands of <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man<\/a>.

Once Peter's identity as Spider-Man was revealed to Otto, his memories from that period of his life came flooding back to him.<\/p><h2>Character Profile<\/h2><ul><li><b>Height:<\/b> 5'9\"<\/li><li><b>Weight:<\/b> 245 lbs<\/li><li><b>Eye Color:<\/b> Brown<\/li><li><b>Hair Color:<\/b> Brown<\/li><li><b>Citizenship:<\/b> American<\/li><li><b>Place of Birth:<\/b> Schenectady, NY<\/li><li><b>Marital Status:<\/b> Single<\/li><li><strong>Education: <\/strong>Doctorates in nuclear physics, honorary doctorate in biochemistry<\/li><li><b>Occupation: <\/b>Criminal; formerly atomic research assistant, CEO of Parker Industries<\/li><li><b>Known Relatives:<\/b> Torbert Theadore Octavius (father), Mary Lavinia Octavius (mother)<\/li><li><b>Distinguishing Features: <\/b>Extremely sensitive to light due to the explosion that bonded him to his harness and commonly wears sunglasses.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><h3>As Doctor Octopus:<\/h3><p>Doctor Octopus has a genius-level intellect related to the field of atomic physics and radiation.

Even when the harness is detached from his torso, he maintains a level of telepathic control over the arms, even over great distances. The arms, which have pincers at the end, can extend to 24 feet at the maximum, and are capable of superhuman strength and enhanced reaction time. He can use them to lift a maximum of three tonnes per arm, though at least one arm must support his body, and he can use them similarly to legs, to lift his body and move rapidly over a variety of terrains, and also to scale walls. He wears an armored body suit because, while capable of dishing out an enhanced beating, his body is that of a regular human, and has become increasingly worn down by the constant fighting and injuries he has sustained. This suit adds an additional four cybernetic arms. His telepathic control also extends over an army of octobots, small, eight-limbed robots.<\/p><h3>As Spider-Man:<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3230881\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.8890625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3230881\"><img alt=\"Superior Spider-man\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Superior Spider-man\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3230881-otto.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Superior Spider-man<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Due to him having Spider-Man's body Otto has access to all of <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker's<\/a> abilities and standard gear however has yet to show knowledge of the Way Of Spider fighting style.

He put his villainous ways behind him. He married Aunt May and got a job at the Future Foundation with Reed Richards and Peter Parker.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, his temper got the best of him, and May eventually divorced him. Doc was heartbroken, but it wasn't until May's death in the 90s that he started to act out. He kidnapped Peter and Ben Reilly hoping to learn the secret to Miles Warren's cloning technique, so that he could resurrect May, the love of his life. Ben eventually escaped and fought Doc Ock. In the ensuing fight, Doc's intended death blow was blocked by Harry Osborn.<\/p><p>In the 2010s, Doc Ock was dying, and with the help of Dr. Doom, he was able to free his mind and implant it into the younger body of Miles Morales, the new Spider-Man. Doc worked with Peter while in Miles body, but it didn't take long for Peter to see through Doc's impression. Once he was revealed, Doc melded their minds to fight in Peter's mindscape, where Doc felt more dignity in defeating Peter with his mind, but when he was confronted by a memory of May, Doc allowed his consciousness to move on.<\/p><h3>Earth-8816<\/h3><p>On this Earth, Otto Banner was transformed into a Hulk Doc Ock, with four gamma green arms growing out of his back.<\/p><h3>Earth-1666<\/h3><p>On this Earth, Otto Blaze was transformed into a Ghost Rider Doc Ock, with four fiery chains springing from his back.<\/p><h3>Earth-9712<\/h3><p>On this Earth, Otto Howlett was transformed into a Wolverine Doc Ock, with four adamantium pincers sticking out of his back.<\/p><h3>Earth-7214<\/h3><p>On this Earth, Otto wore Dr. Doom like armor and robes and was the Sorcerer Supreme.<\/p><h2>In Other Media<\/h2><h3><ins>Animation<\/ins><\/h3><h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-man\/4075-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-9\"><i>Spider-Man<\/i><\/a> (1967)<\/h4><p>Doctor Octopus appears in the episodes \"The Power of Doctor Octopus\" and \"The Terrible Triumph of Doctor Octopus.\" He is played by Vernon Chapman.<\/p><h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/the-incredible-hulk\/4075-144\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-144\"><i>Spider-Man<\/i> <\/a>(1981)<\/h4><p>He appears in the episode \"Bubble, Bubble, Boil and Trouble\".

This version of the character draws more heavily from the modern comics, with Doc Ock being physically handicapped and requiring a life support device to breathe. Once a promising OsCorp scientist and a friend of Curt Conners, Otto Octavius was paralyzed from the neck down due to a catastrophic lab accident. To deal with this new disability, Octavius was outfitted with a special life support suit and mechanical tentacles that enable him to move around. He works with Norman Osborn throughout the first season as a recurring threat to Spider-Man, operating out of a secret lab underneath the Hudson River. As the series progresses, Doc Ock clashes with Spider-Man and his S.H.I.E.L.D. team on numerous occasions, eventually forming alliances with the likes of the Sinister Six and even HYDRA.<\/p><p>He was voiced by <a href=\"\/tom-kenny\/4040-68226\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68226\">Tom Kenny<\/a>.<\/p><h4><a href=\"\/marvels-spiderman\/4075-716\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-716\"><em>Marvel's Spider-Man<\/em><\/a><\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7122451-super%20comic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7122451\" data-ratio=\"0.525\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7122451-super%20comic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7122451\"><img alt=\"Otto as Superior Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/7122451-super%20comic.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7122451-super%20comic.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/7122451-super%20comic.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Otto as Superior Spider-Man\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/7122451-super%20comic.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7122451-super%20comic.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/7122451-super%20comic.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Otto as Superior Spider-Man<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Doc Ock appears as a recurring villain in the series.

She is voiced by Tara Strong. As head scientist for Alchemax's Shadow Division Dr. Serena Patel is responsible for conducting horrific experiments and creating highly advanced, dangerous weaponry, all of which she sees as nothing more than scientific endeavours. Upon learning of Spider-man's conquest against Alchemax she fears the worst for her twisted ambitions, and as a preemptive measure takes to manufacturing a battlesuit similar to that of her idol, and present time counterpart, Otto Octavius. Believing the Heroic Age Spider-man was killed by Octavius she sets in motions plans to defeat Spider-man 2099, which involves manipulating the simple-minded Scorpion a.k.a Kron Stone, and the creation of the unidentified Hobgoblin. Having discovered a fragment from the tablet of Order and Chaos her sanity is pushed over the edge, evidenced by the creation of a condensed matter reactor and development of megalomaniac aspirations, such as world domination. The first encounter between her and Spider-man results in him initiating a self-destruct sequence for her base of operations. Both escape unscathed and engage each other once again at the, previously built, condensed matter reactor. To avert the destruction of this weapon she unleashes creatures fitted with her tentacle technology, as Spider-man attempts to bring down four reactor power core. She is, however, unsuccessful and defeated by Spider-man 2099, while he reclaims the tablet fragment.<\/p><h4><em>Spider-Man: Edge of Time<\/em><\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4727086\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4727086\"><img alt=\"Atrocity\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.png 800w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Atrocity\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.png 800w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4727086-6430589364-20351.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Atrocity<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A consequence of Walter Sloan's (company 'founder') machinations mean that Alchemax was formed in the seventies, far earlier than it had previously been established. Doctor Octopus, voiced by Dave B. Mitchell, due to the altered timeline, appears as a citizen that had never taken up criminal activities. He is, instead, an employed scientist for Alchemax who retains his four mechanical tentacles but utilizes them for his research rather than villainous purposes. His primary appearance is only brief, albeit an integral piece of the storyline towards the climax though. While he and Sloan use a mind-controlled Anti-Venom to subdue and kill the original Spider-man, they are foiled at the last second by the intervention of Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara) and all three are pushed into the temporal gateway, resulting in their merger and the formation of a creature that comes to be known as Atrocity, which closely resembles an enlarged Anti-Venom with tentacles. The two Spidermen soon discover the identity of this beast and realise they must reverse this process by separating them using the temporal gateway. While Spider-man battles the Atrocity, Spider-man 2099 faces off against the Alchemax CEO which, coincidentally, is revealed to be a corrupt, future incarnation of Peter Parker. As the Atrocity's tentacles are systematically removed and tossed into the portal, they arrive as aid for Miguel O'Hara when they momentarily disable Alchemax's CEO.<\/p><h4><em>Marvel: Avengers Alliance<\/em><\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4727077-5204254696-556df.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4727077\" data-ratio=\"1.2937595129376\" data-width=\"657\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 657px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4727077-5204254696-556df.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4727077\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" data-width=\"494\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4727077-5204254696-556df.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4727077-5204254696-556df.jpg 657w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4727077-5204254696-556df.jpg 494w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4727077-5204254696-556df.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4727077-5204254696-556df.jpg 657w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4727077-5204254696-556df.jpg 494w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" data-width=\"494\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>In this game, Doctor Octopus is a recurring boss.

In a notable departure from the comics, this version of Octavius is introduced as a kind and friendly researcher who employs Peter Parker at his laboratory. In his youth, Otto was best friends with Norman Osborn, and helped found OsCorp with him. However, he left the company after Norman began engaging in dangerous and unethical genetic experiments, including one that resulted in the death of<a href=\"\/mister-negative\/4005-49969\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49969\"> Martin Li<\/a>'s parents. After leaving OsCorp, Octavius started his own company, but quickly ran out of money, resulting in him not becoming as famous as his former friend. Despite his cheerful and polite demeanor, Otto secretly harbors intense bitterness over this perceived betrayal, leading to a decades-long hatred of Osborn.<\/p><p>In the present, he and Peter are working on a special project to create advanced cybernetic limbs, which will hopefully be used to help people with physical handicaps. As the game progresses, Otto reveals that he also has a personal stake in the experiment, as he is suffering from a degenerative disease that is slowly destroying the motor functions in his body. He believes that the prosthetic limbs he and Peter are developing will be able to replace his arms and legs after the disease progresses. Otto has seemingly has a breakthrough after Peter inspires him to create a neural interface that allows him to directly control the prosthetics, but the imperfect system turns out to have dangerous psychological effects. The brain implant begins to drive Otto insane, and causes his deep seated resentment towards Osborn take hold. Octavius becomes Doctor Octopus, and sets out to destroy Norman's empire and expose his crimes to the world, hoping to ruin his life before ultimately killing him.<\/p><p>Doc Ock stages a massive breakout at the<a href=\"\/the-raft\/4020-50736\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\"> Raft<\/a>, and gathers a group of Spider-Man's enemies together to form the Sinister Six. He then releases the Devil's Breath, a dangerous disease that Osborn had accidentally developed, into New York City, infecting countless citizens. With the city in chaos, the Sinister Six begin targeting various locations connected to Osborn, but are defeated by Spider-Man. Octavius kidnaps Norman and takes him to the top of the<a href=\"\/oscorp-industries\/4020-56725\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56725\"> OsCorp <\/a>building, hoping to force a confession out of him for the whole world to see. The plot is foiled when Spider-Man arrives and saves Norman, leading to a final confrontation between mentor and pupil. Spider-Man pleads with Octavius to stop this madness and surrender the cure for Devil's Breath, hoping to appeal to the goodness still inside Otto. However, the implant has caused too much damage to Otto's mind, and the two engage in a fierce battle. Spider-Man ultimately emerges victorious, and removes the implant from Otto's skull. Powerless, Otto pleads with his former pupil and begs him to join forces, but a heartbroken Spider-Man leaves him for the police.<\/p><h4>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order (2019)<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7302253\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7302253\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Alliance 3\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg 3360w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Alliance 3\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg 3360w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/7302253-ua3%20ock.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ultimate Alliance 3<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Doctor Octopus appears as a boss character in the third <em>Ultimate Alliance game<\/em>, with William Salyers reprising his role.

His athletic prowess and phenomenal speed on the pitch earned him the nickname \"Flash\" and made him one of the most popular kids in the class. While his popularity made life easier at school, he had a difficult life at home. His father Harry\u2014an alcoholic police officer\u2014beat him regularly and derided Flash's athleticism despite his many accomplishments. Due to his rough life at home, Flash often took his anger out on other students who he felt were weak, such as \"Puny\" <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Peter Parker<\/a>, who was one of his regular victims. While attending Midtown, Flash began dating <a href=\"\/liz-allan\/4005-15408\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15408\"> Liz Allan<\/a>, who was the most popular girl in school. When Liz started to develop an attraction towards Peter, Flash became jealous and began targeting Parker with his bullying almost exclusively. After <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Spider-Man<\/a> made his first appearance, however, Flash unknowingly became Parker's greatest\u2014and sometimes only\u2014fan.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Flash Thompson was created by Marvel artists <a href=\"\/stan-lee\/4040-40467\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\"> Stan Lee<\/a> and <a href=\"\/steve-ditko\/4040-4026\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\"> Steve Ditko<\/a> in 1962.

He rapidly developed a friendship there with fellow students <a href=\"\/harry-osborn\/4005-2478\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\"> Harry Osborn<\/a> and <a href=\"\/gwen-stacy\/4005-1480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\"> Gwen Stacy<\/a>. In an unexpected attempt at inclusion, Flash tried to introduce Parker to Gwen and Harry, but Peter's mind was occupied with his <a href=\"\/aunt-may\/4005-1780\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\"> Aunt May's<\/a> ailing health and he failed to introduce himself, ignoring them completely. Harry and Flash misinterpreted this as snobbery and felt slighted by the incident. Because of this, Peter continued to be a target of bullying from Flash and now Harry as well, who both repeatedly annoyed and picked at Peter. Despite this and because of Gwen's repeated attempts to befriend Peter, little by little, Parker became a part of Flash's circle. Flash also became friends with <a href=\"\/mary-jane\/4005-13380\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\"> Mary Jane<\/a> who was Peter's best friend at the time and who he introduced to the group.<\/p><p>Before graduation, Flash suddenly decided to enroll in the army. The entire group, including Parker, were supportive of him and what they felt was a brave and noble decision. While stationed in South East Asia, he met Vietnamese native <a href=\"\/sha-shan\/4005-17635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17635\"> Sha Shan<\/a> and fell in love with her. When he later returned to New York, he bumped into Sha Shan in a restaurant. She refused to talk with him at first but Flash persisted until he learned the reason for her strange behavior. She had become a supervillain and enemy of Spider-Man known as \"Sister Sun,\" a member of the <a href=\"\/legion-of-light\/4060-56633\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56633\"> Legion of Light<\/a>. She'd been forced into membership by her husband, Achmed Korba ( <a href=\"\/brother-power\/4005-34906\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34906\"> Brother Power<\/a>). With the help of Spider-Man and <a href=\"\/razorback\/4005-6057\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6057\"> Razorback<\/a>, Flash succeeded in liberating Sha Shan from her involvement with the Legion and her unhappy marriage, and she became Flash's girlfriend. Thompson's relationship with Sha Shan would not last, however. After a brief separation from her, Flash\u2014buckling under mental stresses and behaving recklessly\u2014began an affair with <a href=\"\/betty-brant\/4005-2484\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2484\"> Betty Brant<\/a>. This would eventually lead to a permanent split with Sha Shan.<\/p><h3>Hobgoblin<\/h3><p>It was at this time that Flash boasted on live television that the villain <a href=\"\/hobgoblin\/4005-7605\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\"> Hobgoblin<\/a> was a coward, igniting a rivalry with the costumed crook. <a href=\"\/hobgoblin-kingsley\/4005-7605\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\"> Roderick Kingsley<\/a>, the current wearer of the Hobgoblin mantle, decided to take his revenge upon Flash for his brash words by convincing the public that Flash Thompson himself was Hobgoblin. Kingsley kidnapped and dressed Flash in a Hobgoblin costume, then brainwashed him into battling Spider-Man\u2014a battle Flash lost easily as he lacked both powers and experience. Later, Hobgoblin weapons, costumes, and other incriminating items were found in his apartment, having been planted there by Kingsley. Kingsley's frame-up succeeded and Flash went to prison. While in prison, Flash was targeted by the <a href=\"\/scourge\/4005-14461\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14461\"> Scourge of the Underworld<\/a>\u2014a villainous group dedicated to killing costumed criminals who believed the accusations that he was the Hobgoblin\u2014but Flash was saved by interference from Spider-Man and the real Hobgoblin. Flash later turned to Spider-Man for help and succeeded in cleaning his reputation.<\/p><h3>Coma<\/h3><p>The price for that victory, however, was high. Flash had injured his arm during a battle against a different Hobgoblin, <a href=\"\/hobgoblin\/4005-26374\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26374\"> Jason Macendale<\/a>, which resulted in his football career coming to an end. No longer in a relationship with Betty Brant and lacking job opportunities, Flash fell into alcoholism. Surprisingly, it was <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\"> Norman Osborn<\/a> who succeeded in turning Flash back on the path to sobriety, however as the Green Goblin, Osborn also tried to destroy Flash\u2019s respect for Spider-Man. Norman failed at this and decided to kill Flash instead, concealing the murder as an accident involving alcohol. Flash survived this attempt on his life, but was put into a coma.<\/p><h3>Spider-Man: The Other<\/h3><p>When Flash awoke from his coma, he became a gym teacher at his old high school, Midtown High. He was suffering from severe memory loss, however, and this resulted in him returning to old habits such as bullying Peter, who was also working at Midtown as a science teacher. When Parker's identity of Spider-Man was publicly announced during the events of the superhero <a href=\"\/civil-war\/4045-40615\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"> Civil War<\/a>, Flash did not believe it and thought that he Parker just protecting Spider-Man's real identity. He even challenged Peter to dodge ball, but got knocked out since Peter\u2014unaware of Flash's memory troubles\u2014thought he didn't have to hold back with his powers. Flash was rushed into the clinic where he flirted with the nurse, <a href=\"\/miss-arrow\/4005-41738\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41738\"> Miss Arrow<\/a>. Flash finally believed that Peter was Spider-Man when he saw him protecting the students from the villains that were taking up the name of <a href=\"\/mephisto\/4005-2635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\"> Mephisto<\/a>. Flash was later kidnapped by Miss Arrow\u2014who was actually an evil counterpart of Spider-Man's composed of shape-changing Ero or \"pirate\" spiders\u2014when she chose him to be her \"mate and sustenance,\" but later simply wanted to kill him because she saw Spider-Man as a more powerful candidate.<\/p><h3>Military career<\/h3><p>Years later, having recovered from the coma and spent time working as a high school gym teacher, Flash rejoined the military. It was during a tour of duty in Iraq that Flash's squad was ambushed. Flash afforded himself courageously and saved the life of his commanding officer, but sustained grievous injuries to his legs, becoming a double-amputee. Flash's old circle of friends, including Parker and even ex-girlfriend Sha Shan, helped Flash deal with his loss. During his recovery Flash reignited his relationship with Betty Brant.<\/p><h3>Brand New Day and One More Day<\/h3><p>Following the events of <i>Brand New Day<\/i>, Flash\u2014now crippled from injuries he sustained while serving the military\u2014attended a party being thrown by Parker's circle of friends for <a href=\"\/harry-osborn\/4005-2478\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\"> Harry Osborn<\/a>. Just like everyone else, Flash did not seem to remember that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Though Peter and Flash were portrayed as friends, he did occasionally give Peter a hard time. Flash confided to Peter that Spider-Man was his inspiration while fighting in Iraq, so much so that he risked his life to help save his platoon. After protecting his platoon from an ambush Flash selflessly rescued his commanding officer by dragging him out of rubble rather than wait for reinforcements and medical assistance. His act of heroism cost Flash his legs but he was awarded for his courage with the congressional medal of honor. To keep active, Flash became very involved with wheel chair sports like wheelchair basketball and racing. When Peter Parker lost his job suddenly, he attempted to earn some quick money by selling embarrassing photos of Spider-Man. Angry about this portrayal of his hero, Flash wheeled himself over to Peter's apartment and yelled for him to come out to fight him since the building is not handicap accessible. While the two didn't come to violence, they traded insults and Flash lost some of the respect he'd developed for Peter. Flash continued to heal during this time\u2014both physically and emotionally\u2014going through rehabilitation under the care of his old flame, <a href=\"\/sha-shan\/4005-17635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17635\"> Sha Shan<\/a>, who generously offered to serve as his physical trainer.<\/p><h3>Birth of A New Venom<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1624755\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/64293\/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/64293\/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1624755\"><img alt=\"Venom (Flash Thompson)\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/64293\/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/6\/64293\/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg 900w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/64293\/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/64293\/1624755-venom002_cvr.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/a><figcaption>Venom (Flash Thompson)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>During the <a href=\"\/siege-storming-asgard-heroes-villains\/4050-31275\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-31275\"> Siege of Asgard<\/a> <a href=\"\/mac-gargan\/4005-4484\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\"> Mac Gargan<\/a> is separated from the <a href=\"\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\"> Venom<\/a> symbiote (later becoming the Scorpion once again). The symbiote fall into the possession of the US government and was contained in a secret government base controlled by the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS was inclined to use the symbiote to create a new super-powered soldier to help protect the country. After trying and failing to bond the symbiote with another host, resulting in the candidate's death, the government decided to approach another candidate. Around this time Flash was approached by the Department of Homeland Security as a candidate to be bonded with the parasitic alien in order to create a new super soldier. Flash agreed and became Agent Venom, controlling the suit with a combination of sedatives and strength of will. The Government put strict limits on Flash's role as Venom, telling him that he would only be allowed to serve as Venom for twenty missions in total\u2014that after he had served his time he would never be allowed contact with the symbiote again. This rule was intended to prevent the development of addictive behavior regarding use of the suit. Given drugs to control the symbiote and suppress its personality, Flash Thompson became one of the government's covert men in the battle against evil. While having the abilities of Spider-Man\u2014amplified even beyond Parker's strength levels\u2014Flash Thompson set out to simply survive all twenty missions without surrendering control to the Venom symbiote.<\/p><p>Flash's first mission sent him to the nation of Nrosvekistan. He was assigned to find Doctor <a href=\"\/doctor-ferid-ekmecic\/4005-82733\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82733\"> Ferid Ekmecic<\/a> and capture him. While on the mission he discovered a woman and her baby who had wandered into the line of fire. He saved the pair by leading them to safety, but just when he was about to capture the doctor he encountered the new <a href=\"\/jack-olantern\/4005-40901\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40901\"> Jack O' Lantern<\/a> who then incapacitated him and escaped with the doctor while Flash gave pursuit. While fighting Jack, Flash began to lose control of the suit, but while the villain had him pinned to the ground Flash managed to throw a live grenade into his mask, blowing his jaw off. Jack survived this and attempted to complete his mission by escaping with the doctor. As Jack was flying away, Flash made the decision to kill the doctor by snapping his neck with webbing. When Flash returned to base, his commanding officer General Dodge dressed him down for losing control of the suit. Later, when Flash finally made it back home, he found Betty Brant in tears, having waited for him for six hours late for a date they'd planned together. With Flash being unable to explain his whereabouts and tardiness due to the secrecy of his status as Venom, Betty assumed that he was drinking again and slammed the door in his face.<\/p><p>Flash next appeared on the run from <a href=\"\/kraven-the-hunter\/4005-2475\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\"> Kraven The Hunter<\/a> in the <a href=\"\/savage-land\/4020-21766\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\"> Savage Land<\/a>. Despite being poisoned, he continued his mission to stop a shipment of illicit Antarctic <a href=\"\/vibranium\/4055-40919\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\"> Vibranium<\/a>, a dangerous and valuable metal. Disoriented and unable to locate Kraven, Flash took refuge in a cave, where he tried to figure out how long he'd even been in the Savage Land. While in this cave he once again crossed paths with Kraven and the two resumed their fight. While fighting, Kraven woke giant bats that resided in the cave and their powerful hypersonic screeching separated Flash from the symbiote. This left Flash momentarily at Kraven's mercy, but he was saved when the bats swarmed the two humans, dragging Flash and Kraven both into the sky. Flash used the last of his ammunition to shoot the bat and grabbed onto a ledge to keep from falling to his death. While Flash was on the ground recovering, he was convinced that he will still die from the poison when the symbiote located him and rebonded with Thompson, telling him that it needs him and knows he needs it. Elsewhere, the <a href=\"\/crime-master-brant\/4005-85181\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85181\"> new<\/a> <a href=\"\/crime-master-brant\/4005-85181\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85181\"> Crime Master<\/a> and Jack O' Lantern used surveillance to capture images of Flash when he was separated from the symbiote, putting his identity in jeopardy.<\/p><p>Jack O'Lantern put this information to use by kidnapping Betty Brant. Flash, still in the Savage Land, had lost all control of the symbiote. Although he contineud to pursue his mission objectives, he slaughtered numerous henchmen guarding the vibranium and blew up the entire installation once he'd hijacked the helicopter carrying the shipment of vibranium. When Flash attempted to contact his home base, he instead received a message from Jack O' Lantern showing Betty as a hostage, offering to exchange her for the vibranium. Conflicted and still struggling to contain the symbiote's personality, Flash flew the helicopter back to New York City and delivered the metal to the criminals. Crime Master allowed him 5 minutes to get to Betty Brant, who was being held in a warehouse rigged with explosives. On his way to save Betty he was intercepted and subdued by Spider-man, who has just recently learned of Betty's capture and suspected Venom's involvement.<\/p><p>In his desperation to save Betty, Flash lost all control of the suit. With the Venom persona fully in control, his hatred for Spider-man took over and the two fought bitterly, wasting precious time needed to save Betty. Seeing his loss of control, the government made an attempt to detonate Thompson with explosives implanted in him as a safety precaution, but this fails as the suit had secretly removed this device and planted it on one of Crime Master's henchmen. After a long battle, Flash managed to wrest enough control from the symbiote to retreat and locate a pharmacy where he could locate some sedatives to assist in controlling Venom. He then resumed his attempt to rescue Betty, but failed to get to the building on time. Thankfully, Spider-man had already rescued her, having gone there directly after disengaging from his fight with Venom. During debriefing, Thompson reminded his team that despite his temporary loss of control, he is still one of the good guys and he was able to control the suit in the end.<\/p><h3>Spider-Island<\/h3><p>Just before the spider infection began to spread across New York City, Flash's father was put in the hospital, bedridden due to cirrhosis of the liver. Flash's father begged to talk to his son, but Flash left when was called into action as Agent Venom to deal with the developing crisis.<\/p><p>Flash reported to a bridge on the Hudson river in order to stop <a href=\"\/captain-america\/4005-1442\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\"> Spider-King<\/a>\u2014one of the <a href=\"\/queen\/4005-41418\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41418\"> Queen's<\/a> henchmen\u2014from spreading the infection to New Jersey. During the confrontation, Flash received a call from Betty that confirmed his father didn't have much time left. With help from the hero <a href=\"\/gravity\/4005-40452\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40452\"> Gravity<\/a>, Spider-King was incapacitated and taken back to <a href=\"\/project-rebirth-20\/4015-55992\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55992\"> Project Rebirth 2.0's<\/a> headquarters. After waking up and escaping, Spider-King caused havoc in the base and almost killed Flash, but General Dodge's dog Samson bonded with the venom symbiote temporarily and saved him.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2064417\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31103\/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png\" data-ratio=\"1.9753086419753\" data-width=\"405\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 405px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:197.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31103\/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2064417\"><img alt=\"Samson-Venom!\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px\" data-width=\"324\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31103\/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/31103\/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png 405w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31103\/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png 324w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Samson-Venom!\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31103\/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/31103\/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png 405w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31103\/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px\" data-width=\"324\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Samson-Venom!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Flash then rejoined with the symbiote and defeated Spider-King a second time. After managing to contain Spider-King and reveal his identity as Steve Rogers, Captain America, Flash was ordered to use the symbiote's camouflage powers to mimic Spider-King's appearance and infiltrate the Queen's base, ultimately to kill the leader herself. Flash was about to kill the Queen as Spider-King when it was revealed by a clone of <a href=\"\/jackal\/4005-10974\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\"> Miles Warren<\/a>, the Jackal, that <a href=\"\/eddie-brock\/4005-6733\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6733\"> Anti-Venom<\/a>, former host of the Venom symbiote <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/eddie-brock\/4005-6733\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6733\">Eddie Brock<\/a>, was curing desperate vagrants in the \"Our Lady Of Saints\" Church. After the Queen killed the clone, she ordered Spider-King to go and kill Anti-Venom. Flash left immediately, contacting <a href=\"\/mr-fantastic\/4005-2151\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\"> Reed Richards<\/a> of the <a href=\"\/future-foundation\/4060-57552\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57552\"> Future Foundation<\/a> to inform him that a cure for the spider plague existed. Coordinating with General Dodge and Project Rebirth 2.0, Flash received updated orders to capture Anti-Venom so that Reed and <a href=\"\/horizon-labs\/4020-57110\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57110\"> Horizon Labs<\/a> could make a cure to the spider-infection based on his suit's properties.<\/p><p>After a long confrontation with Anti-Venom, the symbiote attempted to rejoin with Eddie Brock, weakening the Anti-Venom suit enough to actually join with Brock for a brief moment. However, Flash reminded the symbiote that Eddie would always fight it now and that Flash still needs it. The symbiote left Eddie and rejoined Flash, allowing Anti-Venom's suit to heal while Flash transported him to Richards' location. Flash left Anti-Venom at Horizon Labs where Brock readily agreed to allow Mr. Fantastic to work on using his suit to develop a cure for the infected. Flash then returned to the hospital to visit his father and they both reminisced about the positive memories they shared of listening to records together in their old basement. Flash told his father that, despite their difficulties, he wouldn't have picked anyone else to be his dad. Then Flash's father passed away in front of him.<\/p><p>Betty offered to stay by Flash's side in his moment of grief and handed him a letter his father had asked her to transcribe for him before Flash made it back to the hospital. However, as the infection was getting worse, Flash felt it was his duty to continue the fight against the Queen's forces. He gave Betty his fully loaded service pistol, and left her at the hospital, telling her that he was going to find an evacuation point so they can both escape. In reality, Flash rejoined the fray as Venom, seeking to assassinate The Queen. In the attempt, however, he is pushed back by her sonic scream attack, which the symbiote is vulnerable to. Steve Rogers himself came to his Flash's aid and the two managed to put her down briefly, Flash using Cap's shield to deliver what they both believe to be a mortal blow. Although the Queen then transformed into a giant Spider form, Flash continued to aid in the battle until she was ultimately killed by the rejuvenated clone of Peter Parker, Kaine.<\/p><p>After the Queen's death, New York was in chaos. All the spider-people had turned back to normal, but had lost their clothes in the process. <a href=\"\/damage-control\/4060-4951\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4951\"> Damage Control<\/a> took care of the problem, but in the middle of this, an old villain called The <a href=\"\/hijacker\/4005-14454\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14454\"> Hijacker<\/a> decided that this was his chance to make one last big score and quit for life. He used a giant tank to rob several banks, and he didn't bother to stop for civilians. Flash, still looking for Betty, found The Hijacker and was told to take him down. Flash witnesses Hijacker's tank run over a security guard, followed by a mother and child. This causes Flash to lose control, and he fakes his own death by allowing the tank to run him over. When Hijacker returns to his lair to inspect the cash, Flash emerges, enraged. As Venom, he viciously mauls Hijacker, breaks his fingers, and bites his head off and spits it out. Flash decides to head home. Although Flash had lost his father's letter in the fighting, he met with Betty later that day in their apartment. She had safely locked herself in a utility closet when she succumbed to the spider infection's transformation effects. She revealed that she still had a copy of the letter she'd penned out in shorthand. Sitting together in their first peaceful moment together since Spider-Island began, she read his father's last words to Flash out loud to him.<\/p><h3>Minimum Carnage<\/h3><p>Flash is sent to find and bring in Carnage, whom has kidnapped the reporter, <a href=\"\/katy-kiernan\/4005-29742\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29742\"> Katy Kiernan<\/a>. He tracks him from Colorado and eventually follows him to Houston, Texas where encounters the new <a href=\"\/kaine\/4005-8667\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\"> Scarlet Spider<\/a>, Kaine. They hold each at a standstill with Kaine about to stab Flash in a moment of anger. Flash loses control of the symbiote for an unknown reason as it returns to its original Venom form and attacks the Scarlet Spider. Kaine does his best to defend himself but cannot seem to slow Venom down until Flash regains control. He asks Kaine to follow him into the <a href=\"\/microverse\/4020-43832\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43832\"> Microverse<\/a> where Carnage went. Flash and Kaine head into the Microverse together. Flash wakes up and is attacked by some sonic screaming pixies but he is saved by a group of people and they ask for his help. Flash ends up losing control of the symbiote again, as the saviors revealed to be a called the <a href=\"\/the-enigma-force\/4060-57600\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57600\"> Enigma Force<\/a> try to stop it. Ironically, a sonic pixie is what calms it down by whistling. Venom is eventually captured along with Carnage where it is revealed the symbiotes were once a cancer to the Enigma Force power and were defeated and expelled from the Microverse.<\/p><p>Marquis Radu wants to create an army of the symbiotes once more to kill the Redeemer, or real god of the Microverse and possessor of the Enigma Force, and take the force for himself. Marquis Radu wants to create an army of symbiotes and use them to defeat the Redeemer where he will reshape the Microverse than attack the Macroverse. Radu succeeds in using Venom and Carnage to create a hybrid symbiote army. Venom manages to get free from his shackles where he faces off against and Carnage becomes more brutal in his offense manipulating solid and sharp constructs to match carnage. He continues to fight against his symbiote's child and the hybrids before Kaine shows up to help along with the Redeemer. Flash figures out the hybrids can be controlled from the parental symbiotes and tries to connect but fails at first. He realizes he must reawaken Venom's own mind and channel the symbiote. In doing so, he manages to defeat the hybrids and Carnage, but Carnage himself escapes by sinking into the floor and is dispelled from the Microverse.<\/p><p>Katy, Kaine, and Flash are sent back to Houston where they encounter a restored Carnage. The duo manage to defeat Carnage and when Kaine tried to kill him, Flash stopped him. Venom was told that the human side of Carnage has been effectively lobotomized but the symbiote remains, leaving Carnage in a catatonic state due to sedation but more dangerous than ever.<\/p><h3>The Evil Inside Us All and Moving to Philadelphia<\/h3><p>After the events in Minimum Carnage, Flash tracks down a group of devil-worshipers and defeated them. Afterwards, he talks to <a href=\"\/hellstorm\/4005-14695\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14695\"> Daimon Hellstorm<\/a>, who gave Flash the clue to where the worshipers were hiding. Flash starts to reflect on his life and the consequences of the choices he made, both in his school years and now with the symbiote. After a talk with Peter Parker Flash learns that A.J. Patton, a victim of Flash bullying in his school years, has moved back to the city. Flash seeks out A.J. to apologize for his past behavior, A.J. tells Flash it is all in the past. But Flash overhears a conversation between A.J. and his boyfriend and learns that he scared A.J. for life and gave him night terror.<\/p><p>At night Flash seemingly controlled by the symbiote wreaks terror on one of the devil-worshipers and also on his own mother, scaring them out of their own minds. A pentagram is clearly visible on the symbiote and the demon trapped inside Venom is starting to wake up. Latter Flash talks to Peter Parker and ask him if he really was that bad in their school years. Peter tells Flash that he made school a living hell for many of the students and made them not want to go to school. Flash tells Peter that because of all the recent events and his past he is going to move away. Flash heads to Philadelphia where he defeats the U-Foes with help from Valkyrie and the demon inside.<\/p><p>Flash makes the official move to Philly, where he owns a new apartment and works as an assistant gym coach at the high school, while also becoming the Philadelphia's version of Spider-Man. He encounters a strange creature that has been murdering and eating people and animals alike throughout town. Flash defeats it but the creature manages to run away. Flash continues to struggle fitting in his new life and even attends an alcohols anonymous meeting. While on patrol, he encounters the cannibal creature and ends up restraining him before getting surprised by the returning Eddie Brock, a.k.a. <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/toxin\/4005-40783\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40783\">Toxin<\/a>. Venom begins his return match against Toxin. The two have a brutal fight with Flash holding his own, but he can't overcome the superior symbiote. The cannibal creature jumps in to attack Toxin, but he is killed by him. Flash almost succeeds in killing him, but the symbiote manages to hold him together and Flash only turns the tide by injecting Toxin with the sedative used for his symbiote. Flash ends up escaping and gets to his home in a battered state. His student Andi offers to help him, but he yells at her to go away so he doesn't form any ties with people so they don't get hurt.<\/p><p>Flash returns to work the next day, but Eddie Brock shows up in order to finish what they started the previous night. The viral aliens similar to the creature they faced during their fight ended up infecting more humans and attacking the school in order to kill Venom and Toxin. Flash manages to get the students to safety and then both Venom and Toxin battle the symbiote slayers. Toxin begins to get overwhelmed but Flash allows the symbiote to assume natural form and becomes full on Venom and saves Toxin and the two finish off the slayers. Eddie is ready to fight Flash then and there, but Flash resumes control and tells Brock he has to control the urges as he is trying to form a life. Brock agrees to let him live, but when the day comes Flash loses control he will kill to which Flash agrees. The students end up safe and Flash gets interviewed by a news team and tells them that the symbiote creature, in regards to Toxin, saved the school.<\/p><p>Flash goes through the week busting what he thought was a drug cartel in order to find their leader. He eventually finds the leader named Lord Ogre, and Flash fights off his guard dogs. Lord Ogre manages to escape but when Flash starts to chase after them, he checks one of the cartel's vans and finds a bunch of captives in there.<\/p><p>While at work, Flash is approached by Katy Kiernan who knows he was present when Venom and Toxin saved the school from the symbiote slayers.

Andi almost kills the fake Jack for killing her father, but Flash talks her out of it. The two then web up the remaining assassins. Flash keeps in touch with Andi after she moved in with her aunt. The separation gives Flash time to think about how Andi became so adept at using the symbiote so fast.<\/p><h3>Thunderbolts<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8050277\" data-ratio=\"0.4906894816306\" data-width=\"1987\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1987px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8050277\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg 1987w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg 1987w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8050277-rco005.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Flash is on a mission in Somalia where he is approached by <a href=\"\/thunderbolt-ross\/4005-3457\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3457\">General Thunderbolt Ross<\/a> who asks Flash to join his new <a href=\"\/thunderbolts\/4060-23977\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts<\/a>.

With his new, white symbiote outfit, Flash decides to dub himself Anti-Venom, the name Eddie Brock had used in the past after gaining his own inverted version of the Venom symbiote. In addition to the previous Anti-Venom ability of purging poisons, toxins, and infections from the body, he also had the ability to heal physical injuries.<\/p><p>He teams up with Spidey and Venom to take on Maniac (Lee Price bonded with Mania). He had possessed members of Black Cat's crew and targeted a meeting of the five biggest crime families. Flash's new abilities allowed him to disconnected possessed members and leave them with a lasting immunity. Spidey offered a sample of his blood so that the Anti-Venom suit would absorb his inherent Anti-Maniac immunity.

He embarrassed himself though when he psychically linked to the Carnage symbiote unintentionally and lashed out on a fellow shelter worker. Coincidentally, Iron Man caught up with Flash at the same time, wanting his help with the many symbiote threats he had been tracking since Knull's defeat.<\/p><p>They tracked Carnage to the campaign <a href=\"\/peter-krane\/4005-170831\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-170831\">Senator Peter Krane<\/a>, whose platform recently switched to anti-alien since Knull's attempted invasion. Flash determined he needed a team to take on Carnage's security detail. Unfortunately, the Guardsman already got to Andi, who was locked up at Alchemax. Flash broke in to bust her out, only to watch her be gutted by <a href=\"\/phage\/4005-40791\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40791\">Phage<\/a> (bonded to Krane's head of security). The only way to save her was for Doctor Steven to splice the Scream symbiote with Anti-Venom antibodies, turning her into a new symbiote, Silence.<\/p><p>With new powers, Andi was able to connect to Toxin's void, inviting both Toxin and his new host,<a href=\"\/bren-waters\/4005-170176\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-170176\"> Bren<\/a>, to Flash's mission. With intel from Flash's friend Hank, who got a job with the campaign, he learned the campaign planned to upstage the President's commemoration of those who died during Knull's invasion with their own demonstration, which they would use as cover to assassinate Sen. Krane.<\/p><p>Together, with added help from Iron Man and Sleeper, they fought off the symbiotes the best they could. Eventually, most of the evil symbiotes would be contained by Alchemax, but Agony and Carnage got away.

Because he was in Hell's Kitchen, he called in the help of Elektra, who was acting Daredevil at the time. As soon as the two former Thunderbolts realized that a <a href=\"\/madbomb\/4055-57095\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57095\">madbomb<\/a> had been stolen, it was set off. Due to their savage nature, Flash and Elektra were not too affected by the weapon and could track it to the thieves. They found a <a href=\"\/deathlok\/4005-7258\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7258\">Deathlok<\/a> fighting <a href=\"\/conan\/4005-2438\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2438\">Conan the Barbarian<\/a>, who had already dispatched the cultists who had stolen the madbomb. They tried helping Conan, as did a few other savage heroes, only to accidentally activate the Deathlok time circuits and time travel to the <a href=\"\/hyborian-age\/4015-55850\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55850\">Hyborian Age<\/a>.<\/p><p>His symbiote reacted badly to the time jump. It unleashed its more primal urges, forcing it to morph to look like Eddie Brock's version as opposed to Flash's military armor version. Flash would eventually get it under control and team up with the other <a href=\"\/savage-avengers\/4060-63986\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-63986\">Savage Avengers<\/a>. Elektra came up with a plan to trap Deathlok so they could use him to get home. Flash's part of the plan was to fight Deathlok one-on-one to get him angry and off-balance. Unfortunately, their plan was interrupted by sorcerer, <a href=\"\/thulsa-doom\/4005-29094\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29094\">Thulsa Doom<\/a>, that tortured them with hallucinations so he could kidnap Conan. Flash saw himself dead again struggling with escaping his grave.<\/p><p>After Thulsa Doom's enchantment wears off, Black Knight combines the powers of his team to help them track Conan. They show up to take on Doom's snake cult, however, Conan was sacrificed to raise the god, <a href=\"\/set\/4005-29092\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29092\">Set<\/a>. To take on Set, Anti-Venom evolved into a fire-breathing dragon form.<\/p><p>With Set banished and Doom slain, <a href=\"\/miles-morales\/4005-79420\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79420\">Miles Morales<\/a>, who was the corpse being used by Deathlok that Elektra awoke with Hand magic, tried to bring them home.<\/p><h3>Escape from Nueva York<\/h3><p>Overshooting their target year, Miles ended up depositing himself and the Savage Avengers in the year <a href=\"\/2099\/4015-56070\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56070\">2099<\/a>. They were targeted by <a href=\"\/punisher-2099\/4005-7613\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7613\">Jake Gallows<\/a>, The Punisher of 2099, and a legion of Deathloks being controlled by <a href=\"\/ultron\/4005-2242\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron<\/a> in this time period. Dane led them to the old <a href=\"\/avengers-mansion\/4020-41036\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41036\">Avengers Mansion<\/a>, hoping to lay low and maybe find an old weapon or artifact that they could use to jump home. Instead, they were ambushed by the Deathloks and forced to arm themselves with old Avengers weapons and souvenirs. Flash specifically jumped behind the wheels of the <a href=\"\/spider-mobile\/4055-15441\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15441\">Spider-Mobile<\/a>. When the Deathloks also started targeting Gallows, he reluctantly joined their team.<\/p><p>Once they got to safety, Miles was able to network everyone's minds into cyberspace so that they could break into Ultron's servers and steal datafiles to give them an edge. The data revealed that this variant of an Ultron-enslaved 2099 was due to a piece of Miles' tech that was broken off in his first fight with the Savage Avengers. It also revealed that a 2099 variant of Doctor Doom was a prisoner of Ultron. With their new information, they try to infiltrate Ultron's headquarters in real life from multiple fronts. Most teams are simply distractions for Dagger to get to and recruit Doom.<\/p><p>Doom would direct the Savage Avengers to Latveria, where his Time-Array Gauntlet was being stored. However, Ultron and his forces had set a trap for them. Ultron easily defeated all of these Avengers, including Flash who was incinerated by Clay's gamma energy. They were transformed into Ultron's new Deathlok Avengers, but Miles was able to reach them through cyberspace and help them purge the nanotech.<\/p><p>After Elektra recruited a number of \"savage avengers\" from the year 2099, the team made one last attempt on Ultron. He had Doom's time-gauntlet, and, as they showed up, his time portal was open to the exact moment these Savage Avengers first left their home time. Miles was able to shoot webs through the time portal and retrieve the tech he left behind that led to this version of Ultron. When he destroyed that tech, time fixed itself returning returning 2099 to its normal state and returning the Savage Avengers to the moment they were lost in time.<\/p><h3>Carnage Returns<\/h3><p>Flash was working as a security guard in the New York, when he started having trouble sleeping. His symbiote was at full readiness, causing him to have nightmares. He didn't know it yet, but Carnage had returned from traveling the multiverse and absorbing powers to counteract traditional weaknesses of the symbiotes. At full strength, he started a mass murder spree.<\/p><h2>Character Profile<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8117442-flashthompsonhero17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8117442\" data-ratio=\"1.5231958762887\" data-width=\"388\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 388px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8117442-flashthompsonhero17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8117442\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8117442-flashthompsonhero17.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8117442-flashthompsonhero17.jpg 388w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8117442-flashthompsonhero17.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8117442-flashthompsonhero17.jpg 388w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><ul><li><b>Height:<\/b> 4'1\" (formerly 6'2\")<\/li><li><b>Weight:<\/b> 160 lbs.

He is similar to his original portrayal in the comics, dating Liz Allan until they break up in the episode \"Reaction,\" seemingly due to Liz developing a crush on Peter. he both bullies Peter and idolizes Spider-Man, unaware that they are the same person. In \"The Uncertainty Principle,\" he had to be a cheerleader for Halloween due to a bet he lost to Peter in an earlier episode, but convinced the rest of the football team to also dress as cheerleaders to spare himself the shame. He and Mary Jane had also been voted the king and queen of the Fall Formal, which leads him to try asking out Mary Jane, but she turns him down as she did not want an actual relationship. After seeing Peter in his Spider-Man costume (Parker claimed it was his Halloween costume to protect his identity), he argued that Peter looked nothing like Spider-Man and he should've dressed up like the wall-crawler himself instead. After Peter becomes angrier and more easily agitated from being bonded with the Venom symbiote, it is Flash that snaps Peter back into reality by reminding him that his friends only want to help. Flash later shows his more heroic side when he and his friends help save Gwen Stacy from falling to her death at the Thanksgiving Day Parade.<\/p><p>In \"First Steps\" it is revealed that he and Peter were best friends in Nursery School. Peter also gave Flash his trademark nickname because of his tendency to streak as a little boy.

However, she eventually went out with him after he reported Harry's use of the Goblin serum on the team, feeling that it's better that he earn trophies fair and square than cheat.<\/p><h4><em><a href=\"\/ultimate-spiderman\/4075-13\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-13\">Ultimate Spider-Man<\/a><\/em><\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5916156-2711494099-8ec9f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5916156\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"564\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 564px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5916156-2711494099-8ec9f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5916156\"><img alt=\"Flash as Agent Venom\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5916156-2711494099-8ec9f.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5916156-2711494099-8ec9f.jpg 564w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Flash as Agent Venom\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5916156-2711494099-8ec9f.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5916156-2711494099-8ec9f.jpg 564w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Flash as Agent Venom<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Flash appears in Ultimate Spider-Man, voiced by Matt Lanter.

Miles discovers spider powers of his own after he was bitten by a spider 11 months before Peter's death, and uses these powers to be the best superhero he can be. Currently, Miles lives in the main Marvel Universe and is a member of the Champions.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p>Miles was born to an African-American <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/jefferson-davis\/4005-86502\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86502\">father<\/a> and a Puerto Rican <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/rio-morales\/4005-4234\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4234\">mother<\/a>. Miles was born and raised in <a href=\"\/brooklyn\/4020-57075\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57075\">Brooklyn<\/a> and has a aptitude for science much like his predecessor, <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker<\/a>. Miles, after being awarded the final spot in a Charter School Lottery, visited his <a href=\"\/prowler\/4005-14874\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14874\">Uncle Aaron<\/a>, against his parents' wishes. While they discussed the opportunities that the school could open to him, the Oz-enhanced spider emerged from Aaron's bag and bit Miles on his hand, causing him to pass out and foam at the mouth. Later, when Miles awoke, Aaron was confronted by Miles' father. During a brief confrontation, Miles fled from Aaron's apartment. While hiding from his father on the street, Miles realized that he was starting to become invisible.<\/p><p>After telling his best friend <a href=\"\/ganke\/4005-80351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80351\">Ganke<\/a> that he has powers, Miles soon has no choice in using his powers to save people trapped inside a burning building. Afterward, he tells Ganke that he is not cut out to be a superhero and does not want to do anything like that again. While Miles and Ganke are adjusting to life at Brooklyn Visions Academy, Miles and his classmates are called to the school gym in the middle of the night. The students are informed that Queensboro Bridge has been turned in to a super hero war zone and that Spider-Man has been shot. Miles then sneaks out of the Academy, and goes where Spider-Man is fighting <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Green Goblin<\/a>. He arrives right when Peter dies in the arms of his loved ones. Miles and Ganke later attends the funeral and Miles talks to <a href=\"\/gwen-stacy\/4005-1480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy<\/a>, asking why Peter became a superhero. She explained to him that he did it because, \"With great power comes great responsibility\". With his new found inspiration, Miles decides to become the next Spider-Man in honor of Peter Parker.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Miles Morales was created by <a href=\"\/brian-michael-bendis\/4040-40435\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40435\">Brian Michael Bendis<\/a>, and drawn by artist <a href=\"\/sara-pichelli\/4040-55359\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-55359\">Sara Pichelli<\/a>. He first appeared in <a href=\"\/ultimate-fallout-chapter-four-of-six\/4000-283008\/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-283008\">Ultimate Comics: Fallout issue 4<\/a>. Micheal Bendis stated: \"He's like 13. He's a kid. His mother's Puerto Rican. And for some reason the borough seems to be an issue for everybody, too: the borough is Brooklyn. Where he's going to school, and his own cast of characters, and his parents, and his family \u2014 you're going to meet them all in the first issue, and it's all pretty interesting stuff.

These elements are just important, too. A kid on a discovery, trying to figure out why to be Spider-Man. It's a big journey for him.

Both cited <a href=\"\/barack-obama\/4005-56661\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56661\">Barack Obama<\/a> being elected President of the United States as a positive motivation and sign that the country was ready for a hero like Miles, who could be a role-model to people of every race, specifically minorities.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Becoming the New Spider-Man<\/h3><p>Miles first heroic as the new Spider-Man was taking on the villain known as the <a href=\"\/kangaroo\/4005-12624\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12624\">Kangaroo<\/a>. After taking him down with his venom strike and fleeing the scene, Miles thought that the suit was in bad taste after being commented on by civilians during the fight. While patrolling on the rooftops, Miles was attacked by <a href=\"\/spider-woman\/4005-75700\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75700\">Spider-Woman<\/a> asking who he was. He was knocked unconscious after Spider-Woman webbed him up, and he accidentally knocked himself out by hitting the side of a satellite dish. Miles woke up to be confronted by <a href=\"\/hawkeye\/4005-1475\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye<\/a>, <a href=\"\/nick-fury\/4005-3202\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury<\/a>, <a href=\"\/iron-man\/4005-1455\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark<\/a> and Spider-Woman at the <a href=\"\/triskelion\/4020-55727\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55727\">Triskelion<\/a>. Fury had a feeling that Miles was bitten by a genetically modified spider, and told him that Miles' Uncle Aaron was a criminal called the Prowler. Before he and Miles could ask even more questions, <a href=\"\/electro\/4005-3228\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro<\/a> had escaped from the medical ward inside the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/triskelion\/4020-55727\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55727\">Triskelion <\/a>and tried to escape. During his escape, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/electro\/4005-3228\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro<\/a> was attacked by the <a href=\"\/ultimates\/4060-40504\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\">Ultimates<\/a>, and with the help of Miles using his ability to turn invisible and using the venom strike behind<a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/electro\/4005-3228\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\"> Electro<\/a>, they was able to subdue him. The next day, Jessica appeared at Miles' school with a case containing a new Spider-man costume, telling him that Fury will give him one chance to prove himself.<\/p><h3>With The Prowler<\/h3><p>While walking to class, Miles saw his Uncle Aaron near the gate. Aaron revealed that he knew Miles was the new Spider-Man, while Miles revealed that he knew that his Uncle was the Prowler. Aaron then asked Miles to work together with him to take on the <a href=\"\/scorpion\/4005-4484\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion<\/a>, but Miles initially refused. Aaron then threaten to tell Miles parents his secret. With little choice, Miles texted his Uncle later at night and told him that he was in.<\/p><p>At night, both Miles and Aaron took on the Scorpion at a night club, and defeated him. Unfortunately for Miles, his Uncle was just using him to become the new Kingpin of New York, and was going to keep using him to take down the competition. Wanting no part of his plans, Miles decided to fight back, despite that his Uncle could reveal his secret to his family. During the battle, Miles managed to use his venom strike on his Uncle, damaging some of his equipment. When Aaron tried to use his gauntlets on his nephew, they malfunctioned and exploded, catching Miles in the blast. Miles was mildly injured, but his uncle was severely injured. Before dying, his uncle told him that he was just like him.<\/p><h3>Spider-Men<\/h3><p>Miles suddenly encountered an alternative version of Peter Parker, who accidentally was transported into Miles' universe thanks to <a href=\"\/mysterio\/4005-4333\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio<\/a>, on the rooftops. Peter, who already confused enough by seeing Miles, attacked him. Miles was able to knock Peter out with his venom strike despite the latter being more experienced. He then brought Peter to Nick Fury at the Triskelion. When Peter came to, he managed to convince Nick Fury that he was from an alternative universe. Fury then ask Miles to fill Peter in about the previous Spider-Man in the helicopter, but before he could, Mysterio appeared and shot down the helicopter with a RPG. Miles and Peter fought with him while Mysterio used his illusions to try to distract them. The two managed to subdue him, but the real Mysterio self-destructed the body he was controlling, knocking Miles unconscious. When Miles woke up, Nick Fury and The Ultimates were standing around him, while Peter was missing. Fury had an idea to where he was headed.<\/p><p>Miles headed to <a href=\"\/aunt-may\/4005-1780\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May<\/a> and Gwen Stacy house where he found Peter. Miles stayed around while Peter talked with the alternative versions of Gwen and Aunt May, until Nick Fury arrived. Back at the Triskelion, they managed to find the location of <a href=\"\/mysterio\/4005-4333\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio <\/a>and made a plan to strike. With the help of Nick Fury, the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ultimates\/4060-40504\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\">Ultimates<\/a>, and Miles, Peter manage to defeat Mysterio. Nick Fury decided to keep<a href=\"\/mysterio\/4005-4333\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\"> Mysterio<\/a> in the <a href=\"\/ultimate-universe\/4050-58660\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-58660\">Ultimate Universe<\/a>, but before going home Peter gave Miles his blessing.<\/p><h3>Divided We Fall<\/h3><p>Miles was shaken after learning that his Uncle Aaron was killed, making matters worse was when the <a href=\"\/daily-bugle\/4060-40822\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40822\">Daily Bugle<\/a> called Miles a murder. Later at school, Miles received a phone call telling him to meet him at a specific warehouse after school. While going to the warehouse, Miles saw a supervillain named <a href=\"\/batroc\/4005-1529\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1529\">Batroc<\/a> and took him down. When he arrived, at the warehouse, he was greeted by Aunt May and Gwen Stacy. They were about to give Miles Peter's web shooters and the formula to create web fluid when <a href=\"\/captain-america\/4005-1442\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America<\/a> appeared saying that Miles shouldn't be Spider-Man.<\/p><p>Captain America revealed that he was following Miles and saw him in action, stating that he was too young to be Spider-Man, and told him that he would arrest him if he continued. Captain America then leaves after learning that <a href=\"\/rhino\/4005-2126\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">Rhino<\/a> attacking New York. Despite Captain America's warning, Aunt May gave Miles Peter's web shooters and gave him her blessing to be Spider-Man.<\/p><p>After having some trouble using the web shooters, Miles managed to locate Rhino and help out Captain America. Although reluctant to use the venom strike (due to using it against his Uncle), Miles used it to defeat Rhino. Captain America then agrees to let Miles be Spider-Man, but he still needs training.<\/p><h3>United We Stand<\/h3><p>During school, Miles learned that the Academy was closing, due to the United States in civil war. Miles decided to use that time to join the<a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ultimates\/4060-40504\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\"> Ultimates<\/a>. He traveled to the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/triskelion\/4020-55727\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55727\">Triskelion<\/a>, and after a brief argument with Captain America, the Triskelion was then attacked by <a href=\"\/hydra\/4060-3480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">Hydra<\/a>. Miles then helped <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/captain-america\/4005-1442\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America<\/a> and <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/shield\/4060-3775\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD <\/a>subdue <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/hydra\/4060-3480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">Hydra<\/a>. <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/captain-america\/4005-1442\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America<\/a> was again impressed by Miles, and told him he could join. Miles was also present when <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/captain-america\/4005-1442\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America <\/a>was shortly inaugurated as the newly elected President of the United States.<\/p><p>Miles was then sent to retake Wisconsin from <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/hydra\/4060-3480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">Hydra<\/a> with the<a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ultimates\/4060-40504\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\"> Ultimates<\/a>. During the battle, Miles continued to argue with <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-woman\/4005-1453\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1453\">Spider-Woman<\/a> about being on the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ultimates\/4060-40504\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\">Ultimates<\/a>. Miles managed to save President Rogers from a War Machine drone about to attack him, but in the process, he flew away from the battlefield crashing in the middle of nowhere. When Miles awoke, he found himself miles away from the battlefield. As he continued walking, he managed to find <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/stature\/4005-40516\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40516\">Cassandra Lang<\/a> (Giant-Woman) however, she was still under the influence of Modi's mind control and attacked him. After a long battle, Miles managed to render her unconscious with his venom strike. Soon after, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-woman\/4005-1453\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1453\">Spider-Woman <\/a>located Miles and Cassandra.<\/p><p>Back in New York, Jessica provided Miles with some new clothes and a cover story for his parents to explain his disappearance.<\/p><h3>Venom War<\/h3><p>When <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom<\/a> attacked Miles' father, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/jefferson-davis\/4005-86502\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86502\">Jefferson Davis<\/a>, Miles had to don his costume once again and fight against the creature even trying to use the web shooters with a new formula that wasn't complete due to <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ganke\/4005-80351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80351\">Ganke<\/a>.

Mary Jane and Gwen show up and explain to Miles about their own history with <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom<\/a>.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/maria-hill\/4005-40824\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill <\/a> appears as well, she reveals that she knows all about Miles and tells him that he has to stop <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom<\/a> before anyone else gets hurt. Miles was about to confront Maria to learn a little bit more about her until a police officer receives information about <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom<\/a> attacking the hospital that Miles' father was put in.<\/p><p>Miles goes to confront<a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\"> Venom<\/a>, using his Venom Blast in battle.

Miles calls for help, not wanting his mother to die. She stops him and starts to tell him of how proud she is and to never reveal that he is <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man<\/a> to his father before passing away.<\/p><p>The next day, Miles goes to his room and angrily rips up his Spider-Man costume while screaming \"NO-MORE!\", thus starting the one year time skip into the next arc.<\/p><h3>Spider-Man No More!<\/h3><p>One year after the Venom War arc, Miles is now 14 years old and hasn't been <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man<\/a> during the time that has passed. Even though <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ganke\/4005-80351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80351\">Ganke<\/a> and <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-woman\/4005-75700\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75700\">Spider-Woman<\/a> try to convince Miles of donning the costume again, Miles continues to reject the idea due to him feeling guilty for his mother's death. Miles also has a girlfriend named <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/kate-bishop\/4005-2262\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2262\">Katie Bishop<\/a>, who <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ganke\/4005-80351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80351\">Ganke<\/a> says that she should also know about Miles' powers and that he used to be Spider-Man. While walking in New York with his father after leaving a restaurant, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/cloak-and-dagger\/4060-43574\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43574\">Cloak and Dagger<\/a> appear fighting against <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/bombshell\/4005-27882\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27882\">Bombshell<\/a>.

Miles finally dons his costume and heads out with <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-woman\/4005-1453\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1453\">Spider-Woman<\/a> to take down the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/roxxon\/4060-56010\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56010\">Roxxon Corporation <\/a>once and for all.<\/p><h3>Age of Ultron<\/h3><p>During the last issue of the \"Age of Ultron\" event, Miles Morales is seen swinging through New York City and notices a large figure within the clouds, that large figure turns out to be <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/galactus\/4005-2149\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus<\/a> and thus starting the \"Hunger\" story event.<\/p><h3>Miles Morales: The Ultimate Spider-Man<\/h3><p>With the entire world believing Spider-Man (<a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker<\/a>) to be dead, Miles continues to take up the mantle and to play the hero's part. Two mystery men in variations of the iconic Spider Suit are marauding throughout the city, robbing and committing criminal acts. The press is beginning to associate them with the Spider-Man legacy, which could be bad for Miles. All the while, Miles is debating as to whether or not he should tell his girlfriend, <a href=\"\/kate-bishop\/4005-2262\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2262\">Katie Bishop<\/a>, about his superheroing activities as Spider-Man. He asks Mary Jane Watson for advice, and she reassures him that it would be best to tell her early on. Against Ganke's advice, Miles tells Katie, who, shocked, runs away. Miles wants to go after her, but is stopped by homicide detective Maria Hill for questioning. She knows who he is.<\/p><p>Aunt May had given Miles the webshooters previously used by the late Peter Parker. However, when Miles returned to his former residence, he found Peter rummaging through his drawers, searching for them. Stunned and speechless, Miles can't believe Peter is alive, and urges him to tell Aunt May and Gwen Stacy. Peter refuses to do so, saying it would only cause them more pain. Miles disagrees, and Peter tries to take back his webshooters by force. Miles stuns him with a bioelectric blast (on accident), but Peter eventually leaves with his webshooters.<\/p><p>The reemergence of the supposedly deceased Norman Osborn (aka the Green Goblin) also surprises Miles. Knowing that Osborn would return to Aunt May's house - the place where he killed Peter Parker - Miles headed there prepared for a fight. He took on Osborn, and put up a good fight, but the Goblin was gaining the upper hand. Just in time to save Miles, Peter came swinging onto the scene in his old suit. The two Spider-Men battled the Goblin's fiery fury, and came out on top when Osborn took off into the night. The two Spider-Men found themselves surrounded by police officers. Miles went into his camouflage mode and Peter used his webshooters to get away, but it was too late. Miles had been grazed by a bullet. Maria Hill pulled up in her car, and ordered him to get in. She offered to help him take care of the wound, while he told her everything about his story.<\/p><p>Satisfied, she returned Miles to Mary Jane's house, all patched up. Miles wanted to tell MJ that Peter was alive, only to find that she already knew, and that she had known for some time. Miles - still shocked - was filled in on the details and urged not to tell Aunt May, who appeared at that moment in the doorway, declaring that he couldn't keep it from her. She and Gwen had seen Peter on television with Miles. The Goblin soon returned, flames flying everywhere. Maria Hill opened fire on the Goblin. Just as Osborn was about to overwhelm her, Miles and Peter came to her aid. After yet another round with the Goblin, Miles and Peter won. Miles's biolectric \"Venom Blasts\" had destabilized Norman's already unstable molecules, causing him immense pain and forced him into unconsciousness. Maria Hill could hear the sirens wailing, and urged Miles and Peter to take Gwen, May, and MJ and leave. They did so, and as they left, Hill shot Osborn point blank in the head, and burned his body so that he could not return.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4989571-5865570722-miles.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4989571\" data-ratio=\"0.75903614457831\" data-width=\"830\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 830px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4989571-5865570722-miles.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4989571\"><img alt=\"End of days\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4989571-5865570722-miles.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4989571-5865570722-miles.png 830w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4989571-5865570722-miles.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><figcaption>End of days<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Katie watched these events unfold on the news, and felt conflicted because if her parents knew who Miles really was, they would kill him.

It was then that Ms. Marvel demanded Miles talk about what he was going through. He confessed what he did to Kamala, and in his shame of trading the girl\u2019s life for Kamala\u2019s, he quit the team.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Mephisto\u2019s offer was given freely because he knew how it would gnaw at Miles\u2019 conscience.

This Miles is armed with gear from the Ultimates (Giant Man\u2019s size-changing suit, Iron Man rocket boots, and a Captain America shield).<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tracking Ultimatum\u2019s criminal network led him to his Uncle Aaron, who has been active as The Prowler since rescuing Miles from the Assessor. Miles botched the assassination Aaron agreed to do in exchange for his new armor, which put a bounty on Aaron\u2019s head. Their only option was to survive the gauntlet of assassins and hired goons to get to <a href=\"\/ceres-goldstein\/4005-144289\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-144289\">Ceres<\/a>, who was willing to work out a deal with Ultimatum.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Miles would end up with a pretty full plate. Goblin would attack him at his school, leading to the newly created<a href=\"\/cradle\/4060-64381\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-64381\"> C.R.A.D.L.E.<\/a> coming to his school looking for Miles. They wouldn\u2019t find him though, because Miles was attacked by a doppelganger in his own home, sent by Assessor, who was working for Ultimatum.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">While being held hostage by the Assessor, Ultimatum revealed himself to Miles. Gave up his whole plan. The drug he was dosing people with was goblin serum. When he switches them all on, they\u2019ll help him take out all the gang leaders in Brooklyn, allowing Ultimatum to fill the void. Meanwhile, he had Assessor create a portal to send all things from Earth-1602 back there, including Miles and his parents.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Aaron was able to break Miles out, and the two met up with Miles\u2019 local allies Bombshell, <a href=\"\/starling\/4005-156715\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-156715\">Starling<\/a>, and his dad, as well as Captain America, to fight back against the \u201cgoblinoids\u201d that were popping up all over the neighborhood. Eventually, Ultimatum entered the fight and concentrated on Miles and his family. He was trying to push Miles into Assessor\u2019s portal, only for Aaron to tackle Ultimatum into it, with both of them disappearing in an explosion.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Order of the Web<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7758730\" data-ratio=\"1.5369836695485\" data-width=\"1041\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1041px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7758730\"><img alt=\"The Order of the Web\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg 1041w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg 624w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Order of the Web\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg 1041w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg 624w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/7758730-rco024_1603376686.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Order of the Web<\/figcaption><\/figure><p dir=\"ltr\">After Miles had a dream of Spider-Man's death at the hands of Norman Osborn, he teamed up with other spider-themed heroes who had similar dreams to save him. <a href=\"\/julia-carpenter\/4005-16197\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Madame Web<\/a> believed that the Web of Life was trying to warn them of a great danger to Peter Parker.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"\/the-order\/4060-64716\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-64716\">The Order<\/a> watched over Spider-Man during his fight with a supernaturally enhanced <a href=\"\/sin-eater\/4005-11206\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11206\">Sin-Eater<\/a> under <a href=\"\/ravencroft-sanitarium\/4020-56488\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56488\">Ravencroft<\/a>, however, they were concerned that he was teaming up with Green Goblin.

He concluded that it was probably another clone the Assessor had made like the one that attacked him during his rivalry with Ultimatum. While running down a lead with Peter that Ganke found, Miles ran into a trio of clones: Selim (a seemingly stable clone with a bad temper), Mindspinner (a psychic Man-Spider version of Miles), and Shift (an amorphous, stretchy version).<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">With their numbers and extra powers, Miles was no match for them, even with Peter\u2019s help. They got away, but Ganke was able to track their cloned phone when they tried to pretend to be Miles, leading him to their lab. Because Miles believed they were trying to make more clones, he destroyed their equipment. The trio of clones walked in on the destruction and attacked Miles. It wasn\u2019t for making more clones but for curing their cellular degradation. Selim and Mindspinner were singular in their view of making Miles\u2019 life a living hell. When they targeted his mother, they left the undecided Shift behind to guard Miles.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Miles connected to Shift and broke free. He went to Rio's hospital, where he fought Mindspinner, but Selim wasn\u2019t there.

Using Billie, Selim baits Miles into meeting him on the Brooklyn Bridge. The two fight until Mindspinner and Shift show up, except Shift was fighting on Miles\u2019 side. Shift saved Billie and kept her safe, causing Selim to lash out against him. When Mindspinner tried defending Shift, Selim and Mindspinner combined venom blasts causing a large explosion, leaving no trace of them.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now that Shift was without brothers, Miles invites him to join his family.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Beyond<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8385571\" data-ratio=\"1.5362694300518\" data-width=\"772\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 772px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8385571\"><img alt=\"Assessor's main terminal\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg 772w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg 624w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Assessor's main terminal\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg 772w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg 624w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8385571-rco013_1645637601.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Assessor's main terminal<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Miles is served papers by the <a href=\"\/beyond-corporation\/4060-65053\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-65053\">Beyond Corporation<\/a>, for misuse of the Spider-Man trademark that Beyond owned.

However, Miles has to pull his punches and kicks, otherwise his blows would prove fatal to a normal human. His physical strength also extends into his legs, enabling him to jump several stories in a single bound. The upper limits of his strength are still unknown.<\/p><p><strong>Superhuman Durability:<\/strong> Miles' body is physically tougher, and more resistant to some types of injury than the body of a normal human. His body is also more resistant to impact forces than most humans. He can withstand great impacts, such as being thrown through a plate-glass window, something that would severely injure or kill a normal human.<\/p><p><strong>Superhuman Stamina:<\/strong> Miles possess an advanced musculature, that produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him.<\/p><p><strong>Superhuman Agility, Flexibility, and Reflexes:<\/strong> Miles' agility, balance, and bodily coordination are all enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of a regular human athlete. He's also extraordinarily flexible. Miles can easily perform the most complicated acrobatic moves as his body is extremely flexible, giving him agility, balance and bodily coordination that surpass those of the finest human athletes; He possesses excellent equilibrium allowing him to balance himself on any object. His reflexes are similarly enhanced and are currently about 20 times greater than those of an ordinary human. In combination with his spider-sense, the speed of his reflexes allows him to dodge almost any attack.<\/p><p><strong>Superhuman Speed: <\/strong>Miles can move at a speeds that surpasses that of the finest human athletes.<\/p><p><strong>Regenerative Healing Factor\/Immunity:<\/strong> Miles possess a healing factor, the limits of which is unknow, and allows him to recover and regenerate from severe injuries. Due to his accelerated metabolism, he can recover from the effects of poisons, bacteria, diseases. etc rapidly.<\/p><p><strong>Spider-Sense:<\/strong> When danger is present, Miles feels a buzzing sensation in his head as a sort of warning system, allowing him to react accordingly-much like the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker<\/a>; His Spider-Sense offers him near complete awareness of his surroundings, and in conjunction with his reflexes, allows him to instinctively dodge or counter nearly all attacks. His Spider-Sense seems to be greatly enhanced compared to that of <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker<\/a>. One example occurs the night that <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter<\/a> is killed; Miles dreamed that he, himself, was being attacked by <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/electro\/4005-3228\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro<\/a>, when, at the same time, the real <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/electro\/4005-3228\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro <\/a>was preparing to hunt and murder <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker <\/a>many miles away. This suggests that Miles' ability may be borderline precognitive, as opposed to only warning of immediate danger. Unfortunately as of yet, he's not completely aware of the nature of this power. Miles is starting to figure out that \"the buzzing\" may be attempting to inform him of incoming danger, but again, he is unable as of yet to use it to his advantage like <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter <\/a>could.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3583179\" data-ratio=\"0.55078125\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3583179\"><img alt=\"Miles using his Venom Sting.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Miles using his Venom Sting.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111115328\/3583179-miles_morales_%28earth-1610%29_and_maxwell_dillon_%28earth-1610%29_from_ultimate_comics_spider-man_vol_2_5_0001.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Miles using his Venom Sting.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Electrokinesis: <\/strong>Miles has the ability to manipulate his bio-electric field and generate currents through specialized structures in his cells.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Venom Sting: <\/strong>Miles can temporarily paralyze his enemies by simply touching them with his hands.

It is then revealed that he has been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the Symbiote in check. As a Thunderbolt, he is seen as a hero by the general public and has his own action figures. Gargan displays his new raw power as Venom in a battle with <a href=\"\/jack-flag\/4005-25687\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25687\"> Jack Flag<\/a>, after pummeling Flag for a bit, the hero manages to stab Gargan, who is protected by his Symbiote. Gargan becomes enraged and ferociously manhandles Flag, and is about to feast upon his flesh, when his electrical implants kick in and temporarily subdue him, allowing Flag to live. Gargan expresses fear of the control the Symbiote possesses over him, yet he has become addicted to the raw unearthly power it brings to him, and cannot begin to imagine life without it, similarly to a drug addict. Later, during an attack from <a href=\"\/steel-spider\/4005-18429\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18429\"> Steel Spider<\/a>, <a href=\"\/american-eagle\/4005-41819\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41819\"> American Eagle<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sepulchre\/4005-42522\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42522\">Sepulchre<\/a>, Gargan loses control again, briefly becoming a huge monster once more, while <a href=\"\/moonstone\/4005-3279\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\"> Moonstone<\/a> is incapacitated and thus cannot co-ordinate control of his electrical implants.

Later on, while Gargan and Brock were battling he injected Anti-Venom with the toxin, almost destroying the Anti-Venom suit. With this the Venom symbiote fully healed, smashing his Scorpion armor to bits, becoming Venom once more. Anti-Venom was able to regrow his own symbiote costume and fled.<\/p><h3>Secret Invasion<\/h3><p>Later returning from another mission the <a href=\"\/thunderbolts\/4060-23977\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\"> Thunderbolts<\/a> were attacked by <a href=\"\/captain-marvel\/4005-1472\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\"> Captain Marvel<\/a>.

It was later on discovered that Captain Marvel was a <a href=\"\/skrulls\/4060-40668\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\"> Skrull<\/a>. Nobody knew what was happening except Osborn. Earth was at war. The Thunderbolts had been sent to protect Washington. When they arrived, Venom thrived in battle, eating as many Skrulls as he could. Later on he was attacked by a super Skrull, and they were both sent flying off they ship that they were on. They both landed among a crowd, and the Skrull quickly changed its shape. Venom, knowing it was hiding then began suffocating people in the crowd with tendrils, trying to find it. When Osborne saw this he reminded the symbiote that while he was all for letting it fulfill its urges, there did have to be guidelines. Venom then continued to do what he was doing before. The Skrull saw all of this and, while changing back into its battle form, called Venom a monster saying that humans would liberate the Skrulls after seeing this. Venom then revealed that it was an act, and that the people had been able to breath the entire time. He said he did this to make the Skrull come out of hiding. Venom then proceeded to attack the Skrull. He badly wounded it with his claws and then started eating it. After Washington, the Thunderbolts continued on to New York, where <a href=\"\/thor\/4005-2268\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\"> Thor<\/a> had summoned all the heroes and Skrulls for a final battle in Central Park. When they arrived, Osborne reminded the Thunderbolts that Skrulls were the target. Venom began to complain, saying that Spider-Man was nearby. He was quickly made quiet. Throughout the battle, Venom continued to kill and eat Skrulls, and was only seen harmed once when he was punched by a Skrull taking on the persona of Giant Man.

After the Void is defeated, Mac is captured along with the rest of the Dark Avengers.<\/p><h3><b> <\/b><b> <\/b>Return as Scorpion<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5586\/1821030-sco1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1821030\" data-ratio=\"1.7364620938628\" data-width=\"277\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 277px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:173.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5586\/1821030-sco1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1821030\"><img alt=\"Return of the Scorpion\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" data-width=\"277\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/5586\/1821030-sco1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/5586\/1821030-sco1.jpg 277w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Return of the Scorpion\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/5586\/1821030-sco1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/5586\/1821030-sco1.jpg 277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" data-width=\"277\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Return of the Scorpion<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>During Big Time Mac returns, now separated from the symbiote, in a new scorpion outfit created by <a href=\"\/alistair-smythe\/4005-6292\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6292\">Alistair Smythe<\/a> and is now working with his <a href=\"\/army-of-insects\/4060-58079\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58079\">Insect Army<\/a>.

They were unsuccessful though thanks to lead actress, <a href=\"\/mary-jane\/4005-13380\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane<\/a>, and the superhumans working on the crew.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Sinister War<\/h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Mac and his new team weren't ready to give up on getting back at Mysterio just yet though. They made a second attempt to ruin the movie at the premiere. While fighting off Spider-Man, in attendance as Mary Jane's date, the Savage Six were attacked by a new Sinister Six, looking to add Mysterio to their ranks. The Sinister Six was able to get Mysterio and regroup with Kindred.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">When they were sent to a graveyard where Spider-Man was facing off against a number of other villains, The Savage Six followed and joined the rumble. Eventually, Doc Ock uses a piece of <a href=\"\/eric-ogrady\/4005-6774\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6774\">Black Ant's<\/a> helmet to knock everyone, including Mac, out through the ear centipedes Kindred was using to control them.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Carnage Reigns<\/h3><p>After being arrested after a run in with Miles Morales, Scorpion is deputized by <a href=\"\/agent-gao\/4005-183328\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-183328\">Agent Gao<\/a> to the her Anti-Vigilante Task Force, <a href=\"\/cape-killers\/4060-65807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-65807\">The Cape Killers<\/a>, to take Spider-Man down. However, he ended up teaming up with Miles when Cletus Kasady, possessing Stark's Extrembiote, started killing some people and mind-controlling others.. He even suggested to Gao that they deputize Miles as well.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, their combined might was still not enough to take on Cletus. Most of Scorpion's team was taken out, leaving him as Miles' only back up until Iron Man arrived to help them. Reunited with Hightail and joined by the new Red Goblin, Scorpion and the others kept a bunch of Carnage zombies busy while Iron Man rigged an EMP to take out the Extrembiote Cletus was possessing.<\/p><h3>Gang War<\/h3><p>When Hammerhead incited a gang war hoping the gangs would take each other out and the Maggia could swoop in and take over the city, Agent Gao sent the Cape Killers into the field to keep the peace in Brooklyn. Frost Pharaoh and The Bumbler were leading gangs against each other, and they have already gotten the attention of Miles Morales. Because Miles was deputized by the mayor, the Cape Killers couldn't arrest him, so they reluctantly worked with him. After defeating Frost Pharaoh and Bumbler, they turned to the Enforcers and their new leader, The Prowler, who were all upgraded with mysterious new tech.<\/p><p>The Prowler had led the Enforcers into a trap, hoping that Miles and his allies would be able to stop them. He then recruited them all to help him take down <a href=\"\/hobgoblin-kingsley\/4005-7605\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\">Hobgoblin<\/a>, who was trafficking <a href=\"\/beyond-corporation\/4060-65053\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-65053\">Beyond Corporation<\/a> tech to the street gangs of Brooklyn.<\/p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Powers<\/h2><h3>As Scorpion<\/h3><p>Mac Gargan was mutated to possess the proportionate abilities of a Scorpion and outfitted with a power-suit to further his new Scorpion persona. Without the suit, Gargan possesses superhuman strength enabling him to lift 15 tons, as well as superhuman speed, endurance, and reflexes that exceeded Spider-Man's. His suit provided him with increased durability, pincers on each hand that could tear through Spider-Man's webbing, and an extremely powerful cybernetic tail. Scorpion used his prehensile tail as for both practical purposes and as a deadly weapon. At times, his tail has been given certain additional weapons, such as acidic sprays, electric blasts, or a poison-tipped blade.<\/p><p>After his return as Scorpion, Gargan was fitted with a new much larger suit which is cybernetically wired into him. It is equipped with a more powerful tail, mechanical pincers, and is bulletproof. Gargan's biology was also altered, giving him a \"scorpion sense\" to match Spider-Man's \"spider-sense\".<\/p><p>For a time, Norman outfitted Mac with a Scorpion suit while the Venom Symbiote was recovering from injuries sustained in a battle with <a href=\"\/eddie-brock\/4005-6733\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6733\"> Anti-Venom<\/a>. This Scorpion Suit provided added protection from Anti-Venom, allowed Venom to regenerate, and possessed a cybernetic tail\/stinger loaded with a super-venom capable of killing Anti-Venom.<\/p><h3>As Venom<\/h3><p>Gargan's powers have been enhanced after bonding with the <a href=\"\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\"> Venom<\/a> <a href=\"\/symbiote\/4015-42358\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42358\">symbiote<\/a>. He also has a few new abilities, such as a shapeshifting, webbing generation, enhanced durability, regeneration, genetic memory (recalling information from previous hosts), and an immunity to Spider-Man's spider-sense. The natural super strength of Gargan combined with the strength of the symbiote allows him to lift (press) 40 tons. <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\"> Norman<\/a> provided Gargan a chemical that allows Gargan to more actively control the symbiote and enables him to alter his appearance with more precision so that Gargan could pose as Spider-Man. The medicine must be taken in between periods of times, or else the symbiote would take over Gargan.<\/p><h3>As Virus<\/h3><p>To get revenge on the Venom symbiote, Mac retrofitted an old War Machine suit with anti-symbiote weaponry. This included pumpkin bombs, <a href=\"\/goblin-glider\/4055-55762\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55762\">goblin glider<\/a>, sonic cannons, and <a href=\"\/shockers-gauntlets\/4055-57499\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57499\">Shocker gauntlets<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Characteristics<\/h2><ul><li><strong>Height:<\/strong> 6'2\" (Gargan); 6'11\" (Variable)<\/li><li><strong>Weight: <\/strong>220 lbs (Gargan); 895 lbs (Variable)<\/li><li><strong>Eye Color:<\/strong> Brown (Gargan); Variable as Venom<\/li><li><strong>Hair Color: <\/strong>Brown; Variable as Venom<\/li><li><b>Citizenship:<\/b> American<\/li><li><b><b><b>Occupation:<\/b><\/b><\/b> Criminal; formerly private investigator<\/li><\/ul><h2>Variants<\/h2><h3>Second 616 Scorpion<\/h3><p>An unnamed individual found the suit in a landfill and teamed up with villains <a href=\"\/grey-gargoyle\/4005-6816\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6816\">Grey Gargoyle<\/a>, <a href=\"\/razorback\/4005-6057\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6057\">Razorback<\/a>, <a href=\"\/whirlwind\/4005-6828\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6828\">Whirlwind<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/bonebreaker\/4005-28822\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28822\">Bonebreaker<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/sauron\/4005-3180\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3180\">Sauron<\/a>.

With Dimitri becoming the illegitimate son of Sergei\u2019s father, Sergei would torment his talented half-brother in response from the beatings he received from his own alcoholic father. Yet the relationship among the Kravinoff\u2019s were unstable, Dimitri still admired his older half-brother as he entertained Sergei with his mimicking abilities. Life would hit hard for the Kravinoff\u2019s when the Bolshevik Revolution forced the Kravinoff\u2019s into immigration. When Sergei\u2019s father died, his mother was forced into an asylum as both Sergei and Dimitri were forced into becoming orphans. Upon visiting his mother, Sergei would gain arachnophobia after seeing his mother mentally tormented in a spider-infested asylum. Later his mother would commit suicide and this would increase Sergei\u2019s fear for spiders and be the first step for developing an unstable and obsessive personality. Sergei learned that the only way to life was survival, and this caused Sergei to travel broadly throughout various parts of the world as he managed to sneak aboard on stowaway ships and trains. Living within various cities located in throughout <a href=\"\/asia\/4020-57815\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57815\">Asia<\/a> and <a href=\"\/europe\/4020-56099\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56099\">Europe<\/a>, Sergei and Dimitri would eventually depart and go their separate ways.<\/p><p>As a young adult, Sergei would finally relocate himself in Africa where he found a natural talent for hunting. Changing his name to <b>Kraven<\/b>, Sergei pursued his talents as he increased his hunting and survival skills throughout the safari. As years passed, Kraven became notorious and extremely wealthy as big game hunter. Kraven would eventually stumble upon the lair of a local witch doctor in the Belgian Congo and take notice of an herbal potion that was believed to give increased strength, reflexes, and stamina. Blinded by the need for excitement with his hunting career, Kraven stole the potion and consumed it, causing to gain the potions benefits. With his new found abilities, Kraven\u2019s reputation increased worldwide as he became a game hunter who tested and challenged himself with each dangerous and rare hunt. Eventually Kraven partnered with Smerdyakov in a business that exported extremely rare and possibly illegal animal skins and ivory. Not only did Kraven gain a reputation with his hunting career, but also became a very well known ladies man who fathered several children with several women throughout various countries. Even though Kraven hardly participated any acts of being a father to any of his children, he only favored one son known as <a href=\"\/chameleon\/4005-4458\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4458\">Vladimir<\/a> who was mostly watched by Kraven's assistant. It was also known that within this time period, Kraven was secretly recruited by <a href=\"\/nick-fury\/4005-3202\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury<\/a> to join his selected team to infiltrate the Nazi forces and assassinate the <a href=\"\/red-skull\/4005-2250\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull<\/a>. After his stint with <a href=\"\/nick-fury\/4005-3202\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury<\/a>, Kraven returned to <a href=\"\/africa\/4020-56944\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56944\">Africa<\/a> to continue pursuing and challenging his career as a game hunter.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Kraven the Hunter made his first debut in comics in <em>Amazing Spiderman #15 August 1964.<\/em> Created by writer <a href=\"\/stan-lee\/4040-40467\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee<\/a> and artist <a href=\"\/steve-ditko\/4040-4026\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko<\/a>, Kraven\u2019s character would be inspired from the short story made by Richard Connell known as <em>The Most Dangerous Game<\/em>. Strictly resembling the antagonist of the story, Kraven would be the first villain who introduced the \u201cman hunting man\u201d concept as he displayed his obsession with hunting and hunting a greater prey than man, which was <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man<\/a>.

Managing to become a serious threat for the new hero, Kraven still faced defeat in the hands of the hero and continued on as threat against Spiderman and also battling other heroes such as <a href=\"\/iron-man\/4005-1455\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ka-zar\/4005-3558\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3558\">Ka-Zar<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/daredevil\/4005-24694\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil<\/a>.<\/p><h3>The Bronze Age<\/h3><p>During the Bronze Age, Kraven changed his tactics as a hunter and continued his career as a hired mercenary and occasionally made an attempt on gaining vengeance against Spiderman on several occasions.

What is known to be his last hunt, Kraven kidnapped Spider-Man and buried him alive for two weeks before going on a vigilante spree as Spider-Man. After Capturing and forcing <a href=\"\/vermin\/4005-6818\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6818\">Vermin<\/a> to fight Spider-Man who just escaped from his grave, Kraven would be fully convinced that he was better than his fears and he finally became convinced that he found honor in his name.<\/p><p>With Kraven deceased, he would spiritually return to haunt Spider-Man in an attempt to find peace with his enemy so that his spirit would be free. After fighting Spider-Man as a revived zombie, the hero forgave Kraven and that was supposedly the last he would ever see the Hunter.<\/p><h3>The Legacy<\/h3><p>Over the years, many have taken the role of Kraven the Hunter and found themselves unsuccessful against Spiderman.

After successfully forcing Spider-Man into intense hardship and loss, Kraven would finally be revived through means of sacrifice and sorcery. Proclaimed as an immortal, Kraven is now extremely unstable and is currently residing in the <a href=\"\/savage-land\/4020-21766\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land<\/a> with his daughter Ana.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>The Hunt for the Menace of New York City<\/h3><p>Dimitri, who was currently residing in America and a criminal spy known as the Chameleon would later contact Kraven. Enticing the hunter into assisting him gain revenge on Spider-Man for his recent capture, Kraven accepted his half-brother\u2019s offer out of curiosity and publicly made his travel towards America. Upon his arrival to New York, Kraven was introduced with fanfare and demonstrated his abilities to the public after single handily capturing dangerous zoo animals that managed to escape from their cages. Secretly meeting with Dimitri and also sharing his potion with his half-brother, Kraven would take a special interest with the proclaimed menace known as Spider-Man. After Dimitri hired henchmen to stage a robbery to attract Spider-Man, Kraven would study this menace that wore and represented the symbol of his greatest fears. Instantly knowing the good nature in the hero and that he was of young age, Kraven would also gain more interest with Spider-Man after witnessing him in action. Seeing him as an equal, Kraven felt that Spider-Man was more than a coincidence, but the ultimate challenge that Kraven must accept to restore honor in his family\u2019s name. Kraven engages against Spider-Man to test his skills and abilities only to find the hero fleeing from Kraven. Spider-Man would later encounter Kraven once more when this time the hunter was assisted by Dimitri to trick Spider-Man while he was disguised as Kraven. Even though Spider-Man quickly caught on to the act, the web slinger still managed to take down both Chameleon and Kraven and left them for the authorities. Even though Kraven never committed a crime by fighting against Spider-Man, his partnership with a wanted criminal spy forced both Kraven and Chameleon to face charges as criminal spies and be deported back to Europe.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/sinister-six\/4060-40429\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40429\">The Sinister Six<\/a><\/h3><p>Managing to escape the ship that was deporting them, both Chameleon and Kraven would wash up on the shores of Long Island. Coming across a Stark industries plant, Kraven entered the facilities only to find himself fighting and quickly being defeated by Iron Man. However his half-brother Chameleon who was seeking to be better than Kraven did manage to fair better as he was responsible for manipulating Iron Man and Captain America into fighting each other. Managing to escape authorities, Kraven was now a common criminal who was blinded by the goals of hunting down Spider-Man before leaving America. After being offered by <a href=\"\/doctor-octopus\/4005-1485\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Dr. Octopus<\/a> to join his group of villains who were each obsessed with gaining vengeance against Spider-Man, Kraven took the offer of joining Dr. Octopuses Sinister Six, despite his attitude by joining forces with other criminals who stood in his way of hunting down Spider-Man. As Dr. Octopus staged each member in a gauntlet style to fight against Spider-Man, Kraven was confident that he would be able to take down him while being assisted by two Leopards. As Kraven tried his skills against the hero, he still found himself unable to take down Spider-Man as the hero left him defeated and left for the authorities while he took on the next Sinister Six member.<\/p><h3>More ways to hunt a Spider-Man<\/h3><p>Kraven would later be hired the Green Goblin (who was secretly <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn<\/a> at the time) to kill Spider-Man, however Kraven was overconfident on killing Spider-Man that he demanded half of the payment which was obviously denied. Angered as to how his demands was shrugged off, Kraven sworn that after killing Spider-Man he would kill Green Goblin as well. Managing to track the Goblin to one of his lairs, Kraven deduced the fact that both <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn<\/a> and Green Goblin were the same man. As a way to attack Spider-Man, Kraven disguised himself as the hero and attacked <a href=\"\/j-jonah-jameson\/4005-1487\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J. Jonah. Jameson<\/a> at the <a href=\"\/daily-bugle\/4060-40822\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40822\">Daily Bugle<\/a> to have New York City against his prey. With Jameson posting a hefty reward for Spider-Man that caused local gangs to hunt after the hero, Kraven found the better opportunity to defeat Spider-Man. Spider-Man managed to fend off against both Kraven and a local gang; the on looking Green Goblin would distract Kraven. With Kraven unable to defeat Spider-Man and facing another defeat, Kraven would respectfully admit framing Spider-Man and attacking Jameson. Forced into deportation once again, Kraven was angered as to how he almost managed to defeat Spider-Man if not for the meddling Green Goblin. Feeling that he rightfully deserved the offered payment from the Goblin, Kraven returned to New York once again to track down Osborn and collect payment. Unable to find Norman Osborn, Kraven decided to kidnap his son Harry at a local party and hold him as a hostage as a way to drag out Norman Osborn. Managing to attract Spider-Man as both men fought a construction site, Norman Osborn would come onto the scene only to be snatched by Kraven. Demanding his payment from Osborn, Osborn would have no memory of being the Green Goblin or making an offering. Seeing that Osborn wasn\u2019t lying, Kraven released Osborn and escaped capture from both Spider-Man and the authorities. With his reputation and pride challenged by being fooled by Green Goblin and fleeing from Spider-Man, Kraven would be angered when the local papers published an article that mentioned the Vulture (<a href=\"\/vulture\/4005-62054\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62054\">Blackie Drago<\/a>) not only defeated Spiderman but was also labeled as the most feared man throughout New York. Feeling that this Vulture would take down his enemy that was rightfully his to kill, Kraven attacked the new villain and ironically both villains would form into an alliance. With both Kraven and Vulture planning on taking each other out after defeating Spider-Man, Kraven only agreed to form an alliance with Vulture as a way to gain a better chance of claiming victory over Spider-Man. As both villains fought the Spider-Man at a designated location, the hero managed to bring down both villains and leave them for the arriving authorities.<\/p><h3><b>King of the Savageland<\/b><\/h3><p>Deciding to sharpen his skills and take a career as a fully hired mercenary. After being hired by <a href=\"\/mr-sinister\/4005-3179\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mister Sinister<\/a> alongside with <a href=\"\/blob\/4005-3182\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3182\">Blob<\/a> to infiltrate the <a href=\"\/x-men\/4060-3173\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-men<\/a> compound to obtain their mutant DNA, Kraven managed to break in and managed to blackmail <a href=\"\/beast\/4005-1462\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast<\/a> into assisting him. However, Beast overcame Kraven\u2019s blackmailing scheme and attacked the hero in a berserk fury. Even though Kraven proved successful, he was unaware that Mister Sinister secretly obtained Kraven's own DNA for his own purposes. Fearing public exposure, Mister Sinister erased the incident from the mind of Kraven and released him with no recollection. After taking notice of the rare Saber-tooth Tiger known as <a href=\"\/zabu\/4005-3537\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3537\">Zabu<\/a>, Kraven traveled to the Savage Land and successfully captured Zabu. Managing to return to New York with Ka-Zar in pursuit, both men would desperately fight each other until Ka-Zar proven victorious over Kraven and saved Zabu from Kraven\u2019s clutches. Angered as to how Ka-Zar ruined his capture over Zabu and facing a humiliating defeat, Kraven returned to the Savage Land to gain revenge on Ka-Zar only to find himself coming across an extraterrestrial alien. Adopting the strange alien, Kraven named it <a href=\"\/gog\/4005-9718\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9718\">Gog<\/a> as it quickly grew into gigantic proportions. Seeing Gog as a chance to help him gain revenge against Ka-Zar and rule the Savage Land, Kraven would use Gog to kidnap <a href=\"\/gwen-stacy\/4005-1480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy<\/a> to be his queen after Jameson, Peter Parker, and herself were investigating attacks on a research team. This quickly caught the attention of both Spider-Man and Ka-Zar. The web-slinger managed to trick <a href=\"\/gog\/4005-56541\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56541\">Gog<\/a> into sinking in quicksand pit and Ka-Zar saved Gwen Stacy from Kraven as the hunter fell from a cliff and was presumed dead.<\/p><h3>Hunter and Mercenary<\/h3><p>Managing to recuperate from his recent defeat, Kraven went through a two-week recovery period while searching for the remains of Gog. Finally finding the deceased alien, Kraven swore vengeance against Spider-Man and traveled to America to hunt down Spider-Man once again. Managing to track the hero, Kraven felt that attacking Spider-Man would be pointless while still healing from an injured arm. However, Kraven found something else interesting when he noticed the costumed <a href=\"\/gibbon\/4005-23687\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23687\">Gibbon<\/a> (Martin Blank) desperately trying to impress Spider-Man into being his partner. Noticing how Spider-Man denied his requests, Kraven took interest on how furious Gibbon was at Spider-Man turning him down. Kraven decided to manipulate Gibbon into helping him gain revenge against Spider-Man for ridiculing him. After introducing himself to Gibbon and offering to help Gibbon\u2019s costumed career, Kraven gave Gibbon one of his potions that increased Gibbon\u2019s powers but also caused Gibbon to go mad. Even though Kraven was forced to subdue the insane Gibbon, he sent the temporary calmed Gibbon to go after Spider-Man and use the rage he had against the hero as a way to defeat him. Even though Gibbon\u2019s powers were increased, Spider-Man still managed to defeat Gibbon as Kraven\u2019s attempt for revenge was foiled again.<\/p><p>Later Kraven took his skills back to being a mercenary when he was hired by <a href=\"\/kerwin-j-broderick\/4005-36676\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36676\">Kerwin J. Broderick<\/a> to kill Daredevil. Managing to kidnap Daredevil\u2019s partner Black Widow as a way to lead the hero into a trap, Kraven managed to almost succeed on killing Daredevil when the hunter threw him off a cliff. Believing that the hero died from the fall, Kraven didn\u2019t know that Daredevil was transported away by <a href=\"\/moondragon\/4005-7214\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon<\/a>. Even though Kraven was arrested, he managed to escape confinement as he was hired by <a href=\"\/arisen-tyrk\/4005-34351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34351\">Harrison Turk<\/a> to capture Man-Wolf and to kill J.Jonah, Jameson and his fianc\u00e9e, <a href=\"\/kristine-saunders\/4005-34319\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34319\">Kristine Saunders<\/a>. Deciding to pit both Jonah and his son against each other before taking out the survivor, Kraven gave Jonah a rifle to use against his own son. However Kraven would be arrested once again before he could properly fulfill his contract. When Kraven managed to free himself, he decided to find a way to augment his powers by kidnapping Dr. Herbert Malraux. Even though Kraven did manage to kidnap Malraux, he also captured the attention of Tigra who pursued Kraven to an abandoned circus arena. Even though Kraven posed as a greater threat against Tigra, she managed to ultimately defeat Kraven as he suffered from fatal injuries.<\/p><h3>Failing Honor and Reputation<\/h3><p>After healing from his wounds, Kraven would face another defeat from Tigra when she was investigating a murder caused by Kraven. Captured and left for the authorities, Kraven managed to avoid the murder charge because of Tigra being unable to testify in court by not making her appearance. Still apprehended, Kraven easily escaped custody to pursue his mercenary career but was forced to hire his services at a lower price because of his bad reputation. Hired alongside with Tarantula by <a href=\"\/lightmaster\/4005-13938\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13938\">Dr Edward Lansky<\/a>, both men were ordered to kidnap and deliver Richard Gorman. With Spiderman catching onto both villains, Tarantula managed to deliver Gorman while Kraven desperately fought Spiderman on the roof of a movie marquee. Spiderman would defeat Kraven when he accidentally electrocuted himself and was left for the arriving authorities. Before being sent back to prison, Kraven made his escape and returned to one of his original hideouts. When Tigra learned of Kraven's escape, the confident hero made her attempt on bringing Kraven to justice once again only to find herself being trapped and enslaved by Kraven. With Tigra at his command, Kraven knew how dangerous and useful Tigra can be for another attempt on gaining revenge against Spiderman. Managing to kidnap Spiderman and bring him to his lair to force Tigra into killing the hero, Kraven\u2019s plan backfired when Tigra escaped from Kraven's clutches as both heroes successfully overpowered and defeated Kraven. Defeated and humiliated by another loss, Kraven left America to the Carribean islands to rethink his plans and how to restore honor in his name. Knowing that Spiderman was his primary challenge and that his tactic of using Tigra to kill his prey was an unhonorable attempt, this was the developing step of Kraven's unstable ego that slowly became an obsession.<\/p><h3>For Calypso's Love<\/h3><p>Taking a different path on restoring his name, Kraven respectfully returned to his hunting lifestyle and transporting zoo animals to various countries. He also would encounter and became romantically involved with Calypso Ezili who was a local voodoo priestess. Taking an interest within Kraven because of his former criminal nature and obsessive need to hunt, she would quickly be disappointed by the fact that Kraven strictly followed his own morals of gaining honor. As Kraven denied her goading as she pressured and taunted Kraven into returning to his pointless vendetta against Spiderman, Calypso would frame Spiderman of releasing Kraven\u2019s animal shipments in New York City. Managing to subdue all animals with the help of some civilians, Kraven would suspect foul play when Calypso quickly blamed Spiderman for the incident. However her continuous gloating managed to pressure Kraven into fighting Spiderman as he tricked the web slinger into meeting him at the Museum of Natural History. With Spiderman showing up to investigate a break in, Kraven showed himself to Spiderman before confronting the hero of zoo animal incident. As both Spiderman and Kraven began fighting, Calypso was watching elsewhere until the arriving authorities managed to capture her. With Kraven nearly succeeding on killing Spiderman and becoming overconfident, Spiderman managed to save himself from near death and continue his struggling fight with Kraven. Overcoming Kraven and chasing him as he began to flee, Spiderman caught up to the hunter as he gave him a devastating punch that Kraven out the door of the museum and next the feet of the authorities. With both Kraven and Calypso arrested, both of them managed to escape custody as the obsessed and angered Kraven plans his next step alongside with Calypso.<\/p><p>Remembering how close he came to fully accomplishing his primary goal with his recent encounter with Spiderman, Kraven desperately trained himself for his next hunt against Spiderman. With Calypso still at his side, Kraven cared less for her continuous gloating and attempts on manipulating her lover for her own twisted desires. Prepared and ready for his final challenge against Spiderman, Kraven managed to track the hero down and attack him with a variety of hunting weapons. Even though Kraven was confident that Spiderman would be defeated, the on-looking Calypso realized that Kraven was outmatched and secretly decided to use a blowgun and shoot Spiderman with a rare hallucination dart. As Spiderman started to feel the effects of the dart and fend off against Kraven\u2019s continuous attacks, Kraven would suspect something wrong when he began realizing that Spiderman was acting differently. Seeing the hero frantically fall victim to the hallucination, Kraven would be disgusted by Calypso\u2019s tactics and decided to save Spiderman from being hit by an oncoming bus. Believing that victory was cheated from him again, Kraven left Calypso to her own fate as he honorably surrendered himself to the authorities.<\/p><h3>First Blood<\/h3><p>After being freed from prison by an AIM agent who was seeking his services to capture Ka-Zar alive, Kraven cared less about what the agent wanted and decided to gain vengeance on Ka-Zar for his recent defeat. Nearly successful on killing Ka-Zar, Kraven would ironically be saved by his enemy when both men nearly fell to their death. Out of respect for Ka-Zar saving his life, Kraven gave up his vendetta against Ka-Zar and helped him recover from his recent injury by <a href=\"\/aim\/4060-13497\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">AIM<\/a>.<\/p><p>After his incident with Ka-Zar, Kraven\u2019s mind started becoming unstable because of how he felt limited and that achieving honor was the cause for his ruined reputation. Giving up his moral code, Kraven continued his career as costumed villain who began robbing stores and various buildings. Kraven would later run into another enemy, when the furious Tigra encountered Kraven after investigating a robbery at a local museum. Not wishing to fight Tigra, Kraven made the attempt to avoid the hero only to find himself forced into fighter to the death after she drew first blood. As the fight took itself to Griffith Park where several onlookers were witnessing the fight, Kraven was unaware the among the crowd was the villain murderer known as Scourge of the Underworld who was planning on killing Kraven. As Kraven fought against Tigra dishonorably, he nearly could have killed her if it wasn\u2019t for the arrival of the <a href=\"\/avengers-west-coast\/4060-29075\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\">West Coast Avengers<\/a>. Apprehended once more, Kraven would be released by an agent of <a href=\"\/mephisto\/4005-2635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto<\/a> known as Mr. Bitterhorn to recruit Kraven to join a massive army against the arriving being known as the <a href=\"\/beyonder\/4005-10300\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\">Beyonder<\/a>. Instead Kraven was one of the many villains who were defeated by an empowered <a href=\"\/thing\/4005-2114\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing<\/a> and quickly finding himself returning to jail.<\/p><h3>Kraven's Last Hunt<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-159517\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6362\/159517-88802-kraven-the-hunter.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.376\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6362\/159517-88802-kraven-the-hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-159517\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/6362\/159517-88802-kraven-the-hunter.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/6362\/159517-88802-kraven-the-hunter.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"><\/a><\/figure><p>One of the darkest chapters in Kraven\u2019s history was when he finally realized what has become of him. After being released from prison, Kraven began suffering from night terrors and feared that his sanity was lost because of how he lost honor to his name for all the prior defeats he suffered from. Believing that Spider-Man was the source of all his problems and fears, Kraven needed to find a way to regain honor by overcoming his fears and seeing himself better than Spider-Man. Kraven obviously altered his self-proclaimed ways to achieve honor and decided that if he couldn\u2019t beat Spider-Man, he could be better than Spider-Man at what he does. With a hunting rifle loaded with tranquilizers, Kraven quickly tracked down Spider-Man and easily overpowered him because of his change of methods. Managing to have Spider-Man deeply unconscious, Kraven buried Spider-Man alive as he moved onto the next step of his plan. Wearing the Spider-Man costume, Kraven patrolled the streets like Spider-Man usually did and expressed his violent form of justice as a desperate attempt to be the better hero. Kraven would encounter and save <a href=\"\/mary-jane\/4005-13380\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane<\/a> from two muggers as she quickly realized that it wasn\u2019t her husband after witnessing Kraven viciously beat the muggers to a pulp. Upon learning of the cannibalistic murders of a monster known as Vermin, Kraven knew of Vermin\u2019s history with Spider-Man and how the monster nearly killed Spider-Man and also finally found the chance to prove himself better. Hunting the creature down as Spider-Man, both Kraven and Vermin viciously fought each other until Kraven proved more dominate over the monster.<\/p><p>Taking him back to one of his lairs to be tortured and caged like an animal, Kraven would wait for the final part of his plan, which was the resurrection of Spider-Man. Buried for two weeks straight, Spider-Man revived and escaped from his grave, first thing that Spider-Man did was hunt down Kraven. With Kraven expecting Spider-Man, the hunter would take Spider-Man\u2019s beatings as he revealed himself successful against Spider-Man. With Spider-Man confused, Kraven had to be sure that he was better as he claimed to be and led the angered Spider-Man into trap that forced both Spider-Man and the scared Vermin into fighting each other. With Kraven watching the fight, Kraven stopped the fight when Vermin was seconds away from killing Spider-Man. Letting the monster escape, Kraven helped the defeated Spider-Man to his feet to pursue the monster. But before Spider-Man left, Kraven sworn that he would never hunt again as he finally found honor within himself because of Spider-Man. Kraven later committed suicide that night after signing a confession with pictures that Spider-Man was innocent of Kraven\u2019s vigilantism during his time as Spider-Man. With Spider-Man left traumatized from the event, Kraven was laid to rest next to the same grave that Spider-Man was buried in. Even though Kraven's tombstone was marked that he died honorably, it was a fact that it was only a self-proclaimed delusion that forced the desperate Kraven to find honor within his name.<\/p><h3>Legacy of Kraven<\/h3><p>It would be years before Kraven would haunt Spider-Man once more. When Peter was visited by Kraven\u2019s spirit to help him be free from eternal torment, Spider-Man finally gave in and accepted Kraven\u2019s challenge by visiting his grave and found himself fighting a zombie version of Kraven that risen from his grave. Feeling guilty because of recent events, Spider-Man was challenged of giving up his life until he realized that his life was worth something to live for and found himself proclaiming Kraven\u2019s spirit to be free. It\u2019s unclear if this was indeed the real Kraven himself or another entity seeing how another Kraven would later be temporarily revived and claiming to be a tormented soul from hell.<\/p><p>Spider-Man would eventually be hounded by another Kravinoff named <a href=\"\/grim-hunter\/4005-15311\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15311\">Vladimir Kravinoff<\/a> (the Grim Hunter), who was one of Kraven\u2019s children that swore to avenge his father\u2019s death and succeed on making his attempt against Spider-Man. Even though Vladimir was possibly much more powerful and skilled than his father, his career as a hunter was cut short when the insane Spider-Man clone known as <a href=\"\/kaine\/4005-8667\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine<\/a> murdered Vladimir. Kraven\u2019s half-brother Chameleon also made his short attempt as Kraven and devised a plan of regaining revenge on Spider-Man for Kraven\u2019s death. Chameleon would suffer a mental breakdown from all the torment he received from Kraven when they were children.<\/p><p>Another one of Kraven\u2019s children would take up the hunter mantle as this one would convince several people that he was indeed the resurrected Kraven himself. <a href=\"\/alyosha-kravinoff\/4005-24652\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24652\">Alyosha Kravinoff<\/a> would strictly resemble his father, but later would follow his own footsteps rather than his fathers and cared little for gaining honor as he continued his career in the film business and eventually went mad after digesting one of his father\u2019s herb potions.<\/p><p>After the event where Spiderman restarted his life after making a deal with <a href=\"\/mephisto\/4005-2635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto<\/a>, another one Kraven\u2019s children made her appearance. Dangerous as her own father and extremely dedicated to her father\u2019s twisted self-proclaimed morals, Ana Kravinoff was dedicated on gaining vengeance against Spiderman and fulfilling her father\u2019s hunt against the hero. Guided by her mother and one of Kraven\u2019s wives known as <a href=\"\/sasha-kravinoff\/4005-63807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63807\">Sasha Kravinoff<\/a>, both Sasha and <a href=\"\/ana-kravinoff\/4005-61343\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61343\">Ana<\/a> would spend their time underground and planning a way to both revive Kraven himself and see to it that Spiderman finally becomes the hunted.<\/p><h3>The Grim Hunt<\/h3><p>After Sasha learned how to revive her deceased husband through means of sacrificing the one thing that Kraven feared, which was spiders. Forming an elaborate plan to capture and kill\/sacrifice all those who wore the spider symbol, Sasha ensured that Spider-Man himself would be the last victim of her scheme. Managing to kidnap <a href=\"\/madame-web\/4005-10670\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10670\">Madame Web<\/a> and use her as an advantage, Sasha formed the <a href=\"\/kravinoff-family\/4060-57327\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57327\">Kravinoff family<\/a> and managed to capture <a href=\"\/spider-girl\/4005-40598\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40598\">Ara\u00f1a<\/a>, <a href=\"\/arachne\/4005-46949\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46949\">Arachne<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/mattie-franklin\/4005-41988\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41988\">Mattie Franklin<\/a>. With the help of <a href=\"\/diablo\/4005-10242\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10242\">Diablo<\/a>, <a href=\"\/electro\/4005-3228\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/mysterio\/4005-4333\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio<\/a>, Sasha first sacrificed Mattie that revived Vladimir who has reformed himself into a monstrous beast. With the belief that they later captured Spider-Man in a trap, Sasha would finally revive her husband from the grave after sacrificing the hero. Revived and angered that he was taken away from eternal happiness that was given to him years ago with the help of Spider-Man. Kraven was disgusted with what became of his family besides his dedicated daughter Ana. What angered Kraven the most was the fact that he can no longer die because of the sacrifice and that only Spider-Man himself can kill Kraven.<\/p><p>Knowing that the Spider-Man Sasha sacrificed was the clone known as Kaine, Kraven would take the advantage of the situation and force the real Spider-Man into a fight that would end with Kraven\u2019s death. As Spider-Man gained extra strength and abilities because of his rage, the enraged hero managed to take out each individual of the Kravinoff family and finally face Kraven in a fight to the death. As both Kraven and Spider-Man faced each other in a brutal fight, as Kraven predicted, Spider-Man gained the upper-hand and was one kill-blow away from ending Kraven\u2019s life. Yet, Spider-Man would spare Kraven\u2019s life after witnessing the future outcome of Kraven\u2019s death and deny Kraven from his demanding request. Managing to escape the scene with his family, Kraven and his family moved to the Savage Land as a way to rebuild a better and much more stronger Kravinoff family. With Sasha angered with Kraven\u2019s decision, Kraven finally killed Sasha by snapping her neck for the recent events. As an expression of love for his favored son Vladimir, Kraven gave his son the one thing that he wanted, which was death. With two members of the Kravinoff family dead by Kraven\u2019s own hands, Alyosha left Kraven in a fit of disgust. Noticing that his daughter Ana was the only dedicated member and wasn\u2019t afraid of her father, Kraven offered her chance to help rebuild a better family after giving the command to go hunt and kill her brother Alyosha.<\/p><h3>The Hunted<\/h3><p>Ever since his family brought him back from the dead, Kraven has never felt like himself. He believed he could only be killed by Spider-Man, so he worked with Arcade and a clone of himself that he raised like a son to create a trap. Pretending to reclaim his former glory, Kraven set up a game hunt with New York's rich and powerful against the Spider-Man's many animal themed villains, whom he targeted for stealing the valor of the animal kingdom, in Central Park. When Spider-Man showed up to rescue his foes, Kraven cornered him and requested he kill him. Spider-Man refused. Not surprised, Kraven dressed in a copy of Spider-Man's uniform and positioned himself to be killed by his clone-son. His son succeeded, but it broke his spirit. He attempted to commit suicide using his father's rifle, but he found a note. It explained that his son has passed his test and that the hunt is now his. His clone-son was last scene cutting his hair and putting on father's gear, thus becoming the new Kraven the Hunter.<\/p><h2>Powers and abilities<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-108059\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/108059-59343-kraven-the-hunter.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.485\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/108059-59343-kraven-the-hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-108059\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/108059-59343-kraven-the-hunter.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/108059-59343-kraven-the-hunter.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/108059-59343-kraven-the-hunter.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/108059-59343-kraven-the-hunter.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Kraven is a very skilled and experienced hunter. With his developed and taught abilities, Kraven\u2019s hunting skills were world- renowned. He was possibly the worlds greatest hunter. Kraven studied his prey to find any possible weakness before making an attack; because of this, Kraven could individually hunt the most dangerous and challenging animals with success. Even though Kraven had gained his experience within the environment of the African safari, he could easily analyze and study any type of environment and use it as an advantage over his prey. Even within urban areas such as New York City and San Francisco, to nearly undiscovered lands like the Savage Land.<\/p><p>Kraven had also developed a self-taught fighting style that strictly focused on capturing and gaining an advantage over an opponent. Most likely developed from his experience with taming animals, Kraven was very well known for his nerve punch attack that could even paralyze super powered opponents. Aside from his experience in hand-to-hand combat, Kraven was very proficient with all forms of hunting and animal taming equipment. Even though Kraven was seen using tribal-like weaponry and equipment such as spears, shields, and axes, he had been seen using conventional forms of hunting equipment such as rifles and bows despite the fact that he prefers more antiquated weaponry.<\/p><p>Kraven was also a very experienced animal tamer and a manipulator for any type of super powered individual who displays any animalistic features or traits. Mostly through methods of physical restraint, usage of mind-altering herbs, and manipulation, Kraven was experienced in having any form of animal bend to his will through means of dominance, even if they are extra terrestrial.<\/p><p>Aside from his knowledge and experience with hunting and animal taming, Kraven was also very experienced with foreign and exotic jungle herbs and creating and designing a variety of potions with them. After digesting the special herb potion that he found from a local witch doctor, Kraven's body became faster, stronger, and more agile than a normal man at his highest peak. Kraven could lift approximately 2 tons and run in short sprints approximately at 60 mph, and he can do a standing broad jump up to 20 feet long, as well jump or land from great heights. Even Kraven's senses became slightly enhanced to where his sight, hearing, and smell increased. Kraven's physiology also increased to where his body could endure a slightly greater amount of fatigue and pain tolerance before tiring. Another result of the potion managed to halt Kraven's age. However, the increased powers and abilities were temporary, which forced Kraven to digest another potion periodically as a way to retain his powers and halt his aging.<\/p><p>After being fully revived, Kraven has found himself becoming immortal through mystical means that are connected to Spider-Man himself. Capable of healing from fatal injuries and not needing the use of the potion, Kraven still retained his abilities and possibly found them slightly increasing. However the full nature of Kraven's new display of powers and immortality isn\u2019t fully explained besides the claim that Kraven can only die by Spiderman\u2019s own hand. So far we have seen Kraven recover from a stab to the chest from his daughter, Ana, and appear fine when stabbed in the shoulder by <a href=\"\/flash-thompson\/4005-1489\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Venom<\/a>.<\/p><h3><b>Statistics<\/b><\/h3><ul><li><b>Height:<\/b> 6' 0\"<\/li><li><strong>Weight:<\/strong> 235 lbs<\/li><li><strong>Eyes:<\/strong> Brown<\/li><li><b>Hair:<\/b> Black<\/li><\/ul><h2><b>Weapons and Equipment<\/b><\/h2><p>Kraven has carried and owned a massive collection of weapons, tools, and equipment that are mostly used for hunting. Because of his fanaticism with \u201chunting out of honor\u201d, Kraven has deduced his collection down to spears, knives, and mostly other tribal used weaponry and equipment. Among his arsenal of weaponry that Kraven used was Bantu war clubs, javelins, spears, bolos, hunting nets, axes, machetes, tribal swords, whips, bowie knives, blowguns, and a custom made gauntlet that\u2019s made from animal claws.<\/p><p>Even though Kraven shuns himself from using conventional weaponry, he has used hunting rifles, gas grenades, garottes, and other scientific equipment like electromagnetic collars and magnetic iron manacles.<\/p><p><strong>Kraven's Lion's Head Vest<\/strong><\/p><p>One of Kraven\u2019s former well-known trademark weapons that he naturally used was his vest, another form of weaponry that Kraven shunned himself from because of its nature. The vest is custom made and also made from leather that\u2019s lined with real lion\u2019s fur that covers the shoulder and back portion of the vest. The interior of the vest is lined with silk and has two secret compartments that holds two elbow pumps which emits various forms of attacks that could stun, tranquilize, and a double ray electro-burst or ultra-sonic blaster. The right elbow pump acts as the main pump which discharges the attack through plastic tubing that\u2019s also lined within the vest and emitted through the eye\u2019s on the outer chest portion of the vest. The main pump also features a safety valve and a valve for the airflow mixture. The left elbow pump is the safety release, which is pumped twice through plastic tubing that\u2019s connected to the main pump.<\/p><p>Even though Kraven has made attempts on avoiding the usage of poisons, he naturally carries a vast array of poisons that specifically slows down his enemies. When using these poisons, Kraven adds the poison onto the tips of darts, spears, or other weaponry he uses in fighting. Aside from poisons, Kraven also carries certain chemicals and potions that could alter his victim\u2019s perception, even capable numb Spiderman\u2019s spider sense. Kraven naturally keeps these poisons, potion, and other chemicals with his tusk belt, which is another form of equipment that he never wears anymore.<\/p><h2>Alternate Versions<\/h2><h3>Earth-2149<\/h3><p>In the Marvel Zombiverse, Kraven transformed into a zombie after having his throat bit off by a zombified Spider-Man and later joining a zombified version of the Sinister Six.<\/p><h3>Earth-1610<\/h3><p>Sergei Kravinoff was an Australian and the host of his own reality show in which he hunted down dangerous animals.<\/p><p>He intended to hunt and kill Spider-Man on live TV in order to boost his ratings.

Later, Venom decided to reabsorb the Carnage symbiote \"for good.\" Without the symbiote, Kasady retained the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees (albeit as a powerless human) but him being a regular man now Spider-Man had no problem webbing him up and sending him to jail. But soon after, Kasady was sucked into a black hole and straight into <a href=\"\/the-negative-zone\/4020-40699\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\">The Negative Zone<\/a> war between <a href=\"\/blastaar\/4005-10963\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10963\">Blastaar<\/a> and the Living Bomb, <a href=\"\/burst\/4005-66243\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66243\">Burst<\/a> and the Super Hero called <a href=\"\/dusk\/4005-4805\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4805\">Dusk<\/a>. Kasady teamed up with Blastaar, Cletus discovered that he had been called by another symbiote trapped in the Negative Zone. How this symbiote is an identical copy, or where it came from, has yet to be explained. So after a quick bonding, Carnage was back. However Blastaar quickly realized that annihilating Earth would result in the destruction of the entire universe and called it off. Carnage, on the other hand, was practically frothing at the mouth at the chance to wipe out trillions of lives and attempted to activate Blastaar's universe destroying machine, but only send himself and Spider-man back to Earth, and was once again taken into custody by the police. So Cletus Kasady as Carnage was back to being one of Spider-Man's deadliest foes and continued his rampage throughout Manhattan. However, the issues in which Kasady discovered the replica had references to the Spider-Man Unlimited TV series which had been airing at the time and which featured the Carnage symbiote as one of its villains. In this same issue, Spider-Man himself briefly gained the costume the animated version of him from that series wore.<\/p><h3>Maximum Carnage<\/h3><p>Perhaps the most famous storyline in which Carnage appears is the 1993 Spider-Man event <a href=\"\/maximum-carnage\/4045-41409\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41409\">Maximum Carnage<\/a>. Carnage ends up escaping from an asylum and attacks the doctors and breaks out a super villain named <a href=\"\/shriek\/4005-15232\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15232\">Shriek<\/a> in which the two start a romantic bond with each other. Later on, they get a whole Carnage \"family\" of psychotic super-villains (consisting of <a href=\"\/demogoblin\/4005-15272\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15272\">Demogoblin<\/a>, <a href=\"\/carrion\/4005-14507\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14507\">Carrion<\/a> and <a href=\"\/doppelganger\/4005-15274\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15274\">Doppelganger<\/a>) and overtake New York in a twisted killing spree where he randomly kills hundreds if not thousands of innocent people and throws the city into mindless chaos. They are eventually driven back by Spider-Man, Venom, the <a href=\"\/black-cat\/4005-1479\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\">Black Cat<\/a>, <a href=\"\/captain-america\/4005-1442\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America<\/a>, <a href=\"\/nightwatch\/4005-7505\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7505\">Nightwatch<\/a>, <a href=\"\/cloak-and-dagger\/4060-43574\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43574\">Cloak And Dagger<\/a>, <a href=\"\/deathlok\/4005-7258\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7258\">Deathlok<\/a>, <a href=\"\/morbius\/4005-6722\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6722\">Morbius<\/a> and <a href=\"\/firestar\/4005-2101\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\">Firestar<\/a>.

However, despite Carnage's apparent death at the hands of Deathlok using his \"Magni Illuminizer\", Carnage shockingly returns out of a lake just as Venom complains to Spider-Man that he wanted to kill Carnage himself. He had faked his own death (most likely by covering one of his victims in a mock symbiote outfit).<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-85030\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/229\/85030-39255-carnage.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/229\/85030-39255-carnage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-85030\"><img alt=\"Carnage the Mad Symbiote.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/229\/85030-39255-carnage.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/229\/85030-39255-carnage.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Carnage the Mad Symbiote.\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/229\/85030-39255-carnage.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/229\/85030-39255-carnage.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Carnage the Mad Symbiote.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>He fought the two viciously. As Venom hunts him down he begins suffering a complete mental breakdown leading him to revisit his bloody past at Ryker's Prison, the St. Estes Home for Boys, dig up his mother at a cemetery in which a final fight between him and Spider-Man and Venom ensued. In the end, Venom dragged Carnage into a big explosion, defeating him.<\/p><p>Cletus was later hauled off to get cured from the alien symbiote which lived in his blood. He later escaped by scratching his tongue against a tooth which he filed down to a needle point in order to release the alien. Spider-man later shows up to stop him with a sonic gun, however Carnage uses two near by cops as a distraction to take out the gun for good, and shortly after kills the cops. Carnage then takes the police car and drives off to visit Billy, his first and maybe only friend of his life to kill him. Carnage figured that people would never expect him to go after a specific target, since all he does it random murder, this makes it all the more fun for him. Carnage told Billy about their first meeting and tells him why he is going to kill him. He says that \"In a world of carnage and chaos there can be no enemies, only victims, making this the perfect example\". Spider-man tracks Carnage down when a battle to the death ruptured. Carnage nearly defeated the Web-Slinger, when Billy distracted him and trick him out of using his symbiote. Spider-man landed a punch square in the jaw which knocked the killer out cold. Kasady went back to Ravencroft, and as he sits in his cell he waits. He figures they expect him to escape, which is why he does the exact opposite, because doing the unexpected is what makes him free.<\/p><h3>Web of Carnage<\/h3><p>In the 1996 \"Web of Carnage\" storyline, the Carnage symbiote escapes from the Ravencroft Institute through the plumbing where Cletus Kasady is incarcerated, seeking a stronger host. It takes over Ben Reilly, who had recently replaced Peter Parker as Spider-Man. Reilly has little previous experience with symbiotes, and is unprepared for an enemy that is immune to his spider-sense. Together, they become Spider-Carnage, and the symbiote attempts to force him, both mentally and physically, to kill Peter Parker (then powerless), and other innocent people. The symbiote's will to kill is so strong that Reilly actually has realistic visions of him maiming and killing. In a desperate attempted to control the symbiote, Reilly goes to Ravencroft, to talk to the symbiote's former host Cletus Kasady, who is dying of stomach cancer. When Kasady tells Reilly there is no way to control it, the symbiote tries to get to Kasady, to reform Carnage again. Reilly does not want this to happen and risks his own life, and sanity, to the symbiote, when he tells John Jameson to put him in a cell and lock him up. John then turns on microwave shields in the cell Reilly is in, to try and force the symbiote off. It works but the symbiote slithers off into a sink and goes through the plumbing to re-bond with Cletus Kasady<\/p><h3>Venom vs Carnage<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-152165\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/152165-112958-carnage.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.505\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/152165-112958-carnage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-152165\"><img alt=\"Ben Reilly plus Carnage equals Spider-Carnage\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/152165-112958-carnage.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/152165-112958-carnage.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ben Reilly plus Carnage equals Spider-Carnage\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/152165-112958-carnage.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/152165-112958-carnage.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ben Reilly plus Carnage equals Spider-Carnage<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Carnage starred in the miniseries Venom vs. Carnage, in 2005. The Carnage symbiote spawned a \"child\" symbiote, which he tried to kill without success. The \"child\" later bonded with police officer Patrick Mulligan, which was the host Carnage chose because he was nearest at the time. Carnage had the opportunity to kill the symbiote child then and there however Carnage was exhausted because he tried to kill his offspring before it got birthed. Carnage felt nothing but hate for the young creature and attempted to kill it, while Venom defended it (oddly enough feeling protective of his \"grandchild\"). Venom named the new symbiote <a href=\"\/toxin\/4005-40783\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40783\">Toxin<\/a>. Later Carnage yet again tries to kill Toxin and almost gets away till the <a href=\"\/black-cat\/4005-1479\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\">Black Cat<\/a> notices Pat Mulligan screaming hanging with an inch of his life on a building with Carnage veering close. Black Cat later stops Carnage and saves Pat Mulligun. Carnage yet again tries to kill Toxin and the Black Cat when Pat Mulligun's symbiote starts to go over him and he stops Carnage. When Toxin realized the power he has, he went off to kill Cletus Kasady and almost succeeded but stopped because he didn't want to sink to his levels. Venom then teams up with Carnage to kill Toxin once and for all, but are both stopped when Toxin, Black Cat, and Spider-Man team up to defeat them. Mulligan has since attempted to steer the symbiote towards heroism instead of murder.<\/p><h3>Death?<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-478297\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.81987577639752\" data-width=\"805\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 805px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:82.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-478297\"><img alt=\"Carnage ripped in half by Sentry\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg 805w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Carnage ripped in half by Sentry\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg 805w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Carnage ripped in half by Sentry<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Carnage was one of several super villains trying to escape from The Raft in New Avengers #1-2.

Wondering if maybe they will offer her the symbiote suit because of her having been near it longer than anyone else (besides Cletus Kasady) without being ripped to shreds. But so far, they are using Shriek to \"feed\" the symbiote her hate and lust for destruction, which she has the ability to do emitting and inducing in others. (like how she did in Maximum Carnage to drive the whole city insane with blood lust)<\/p><p>Later, Cletus Kasady makes a return.

Spider-Man and Iron Man believe it to be going for revenge to kill the man who kept it locked up, but instead it went straight for Kasady, who has new bio-mechanical legs from being ripped in two. The bond between the symbiote and its host was so strong that the symbiote almost died in space just to keep Cletus alive. The symbiote bonded to Kasady once more and Carnage went on a murderous rampage after Michael Hall, but the security of Royal Blue and the rest arrive to stop Carnage. It is later revealed that Michael Hall used parts of the Carnage symbiote to build their suits. Carnage used a mental link to snap the bones and kill the wearers of the suits then he began to merge with the suits just as he did in Planet of the Symbiotes, growing larger and far stronger. Spider-man and Iron Man showed up, but by then it was too late.<\/p><p>The team tried hard to defeat Carnage but things got more difficult when Shriek and Doppleganger made it to the scene. Carnage seemed to not care much that Shriek was around and was much more focused on killing then thanking Shriek for saving him at one point. He almost killed Iron Man but was temped more to kill Spider-Man. He was stopped when a part of the symbiote took over Tanis and transformed into Scorn. Scorn made Shriek aim a sonic scream at Carnage, knocking him down. He was then beaten violently and torn into by Spider-Man attacking him with a street meter but managed to escape before Spider-Man could get through the giant suit.<\/p><p>Later it turns out Cletus is hiding in a beach house with Doppleganger watching TV and plotting a comeback.<\/p><h3>Carnage USA<\/h3><p>In the small American town of Doverton, Colorado, Carnage returns. After consuming all the meat and staff in the local meat packing factory, the symbiote infects the town by making its way through the sinks and drains.

When the Thing uses a sonic weapon on Carnage, it results in the heroes becoming infected with the bloodthirsty symbiote, and facing off with Spider-Man.<\/p><p>With the heroes out of action, the government turns to its other contigency plans; <a href=\"\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom<\/a>, <a href=\"\/toxin\/4005-40783\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40783\">Toxin<\/a>, <a href=\"\/hybrid\/4005-24129\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24129\">Hybrid<\/a>, <a href=\"\/scorn\/4005-10467\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10467\">Scorn<\/a> and <a href=\"\/eddie-brock\/4005-6733\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6733\">Anti-Venom<\/a>. Spider-Man escapes his symbiote infected allies, as Carnage uses them like puppets against him. He is rescued by the townsfolk who have avoided Carnage, and they use molotov fire bombs to make their getaway from the town center, to their base on a fenced in, private zoo.<\/p><p>Meanwhile the government send in soldiers who have been enhanced with symbiotes, and their mission is to stop Carnage and rescue the civilians before the town is bombed to save the world from Carnage's outbreak. Scorn is also deployed to stop Carnage, but she spends time in her base melding her symbiote with mechanical devices around herself. Spider-Man rallies the un-infected towns folk, they are going to make an attack against Carnage in a last ditch effort to save the town. The symbiote-soldiers are already in the town, fighting off waves of symbiote infected people. As they are running out of ammo, Carnage and the Avengers team he is controlling come out to face them. It looks like the soldiers are doomed, but Spider-Man and the townsfolk arrive and attack Carnage with more molotovs.<\/p><p>While wrestling with Spider-Man, Carnage gains the upper hand and is about to carve out Spider-Man's eyes, when <a href=\"\/flash-thompson\/4005-1489\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Venom<\/a> (Flash Thompson) jumps in and rescues Spider-Man by shooting Carnage with sonic bullets.

Flash recovers, and is left in his legless human form with Cletus Kasady standing over him with a shard of glass, ready to kill Flash.<\/p><p>The symbiotes go rogue, and manage to find zoo animals that escaped from a private reserve and bond to them. The Venom symbiote bonds to a gorilla, while the Carnage symbiote bonds to several monkeys, a few giraffes, and even a lion. Meanwhile, Cletus's bionic legs fall apart due to the glass tank affecting the symbiotic circuitry. Flash and Cletus have a brutal fight, impaling each other with meat hooks and glass. With help from the Avengers and Scorn, the Venom symbiote gorilla makes it's way back to Flash, leaving the gorilla and bonding to him again. Flash takes advantage of Cletus's lost limbs and easily wins the confrontation, but doesn't kill Cletus.<\/p><p>After the government changes plans from bombing the entire town to a localized assault - killing the zoo animal Carnage symbiotes - Scorn collects the last remaining remnant of the Carnage symbiote for an unknown second objective. The assault on the zoo animal symbiotes leaves the town devastated. Meanwhile, Flash brings Cletus in alive. He tells Captain America that if he had killed Cletus he wouldn't be able to face Spider-Man, Cap assures him that Cletus was meant to be brought in alive. Cletus and the symbiote are then taken from the town and into custody.<\/p><h3>Minimum Carnage<\/h3><p>In <a href=\"\/minimum-carnage\/4045-56935\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56935\">Minimum Carnage<\/a>, Carnage is made stronger (incorporating hybrid clones of himself and <a href=\"\/venom\/4005-1486\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom<\/a> from the <a href=\"\/microverse\/4020-43832\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43832\">Microverse<\/a> into his <a href=\"\/symbiotes\/4060-56880\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56880\">symbiote<\/a>).

The person they decide to use is <a href=\"\/dr-karl-malus\/4005-3143\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3143\">Dr. Karl Malus<\/a>, fellow scientist and fourth member of the Frightful Four. After dragging him from his wheelchair and forcing him to undergo a blood transfusion with Kasady, Malus morphs into Carnage and attacks Klaw and Wizard with the intent of killing them, thankfully for them, Wizard manages to take control of Malus's mind and make him his servant: <strong>The Superior Carnage!<\/strong><\/p><p>With his Frightful Four finally assembled, Wizard storms city hall with the intent of killing <a href=\"\/j-jonah-jameson\/4005-1487\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J. Jonah Jameson<\/a> and taking control of NYC. Once they reached the mayor's office, they discovered that the mayor was taken to a safe bunker and instead, they meet <a href=\"\/doctor-octopus\/4005-1485\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Spider-Man<\/a> and his <a href=\"\/spider-minions\/4060-59944\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59944\">Spider-Minions<\/a>.<\/p><p>The two sides immediately attack each other, with Carnage slaying the spider-minions and then goes after Spider-man himself. During the fight, Spider-man throws Wizard out of the window and out into the street below. Now free from Wizard's control, Carnage attacks Klaw, temporarily disposing of him while he goes to kill Spider-Man. During the fight between Carnage and Spidey, Klaw recovers and attacks Spider-man to protect his friend Wizard. While Klaw is blasting Spider-Man with his sonic scream, Carnage stabs Klaw through the back with a vibranium blade. This pierces his suit and causes him to explode into a sonic boom<\/p><p>The sonic boom from Klaw's explosion caused the Symbiote to abandon Malus and attach itself to Wizard. Given the power of Carnage, Wizard goes on a rampage and throws a car at Spider-Man and the now powerless Dr. Malus. Spider-Man stops the car and fights the new Carnage one-on-one! This new Carnage taunts Spider-Man by telling him that he knows he is really <a href=\"\/doctor-octopus\/4005-1485\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Doctor Octopus<\/a>. Spider-Man continues to fight Carnage, trying to buy Dr. Malus time to escape, but Malus is handicapped and can't even walk. So Carnage \"helps\" his former host by ridding him of his pesky legs, ripping them off of his body.<\/p><p>Out of options, Spider-Man uses his last resort, and wheels out the body of Cletus Kasady, the original host of Carnage. The symbiote abandons its current host and attaches to Kasady, becoming whole once more. For some reason unknown, Carnage reattaching itself to Kasady healed his brain and he was now once again at his pre-Minimum Carnage level of intelligence. Kasady was subsequently struck by lightning from the surviving essence of Klaw, and Spider-Man brought Carnage back into custody<\/p><h3>Deadpool vs Carnage<\/h3><p>After the events of Superior Carnage in which the symbiote healed Kasady's mind, Carnage is back on one of his murderous rampages in which he attacks a small caf\u00e9. After believing its his destiny to defeat Carnage, Deadpool goes after him. Although his first attempt would have been a success, Shriek prevents Wade from completing his mission but, after a couple of attempts, Deadpool is finally able to beat Carnage with the help of four other symbiotes. At the end of the series, Carnage swears he will get his vengeance.<\/p><h3>Axis<\/h3><p>Carnage is one of the villains who responds to <a href=\"\/magneto\/4005-1441\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto<\/a>'s request for help against <a href=\"\/red-skull\/4005-2250\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Onslaught <\/a>but, after <a href=\"\/scarlet-witch\/4005-1466\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch<\/a> and <a href=\"\/doctor-doom\/4005-1468\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom<\/a> perform a spell, his personality is inversed and he wishes to become a hero. After performing a number of \"heroic\" deeds in New York, Carnage joins Spider-Man and a number of other inverted heroes against the inverted heroes. He is seen sacrificing himself by rapping the symbiote over a bomb that is set to kill everyone on the planet who wasn't a mutant.<\/p><h3>Post-Axis<\/h3><p>Cletus was able to survive the gene bomb's explosion, though he lost his legs in the process. Cured of his inversion after a counterspell was cast and disgusted by his behavior as a hero, he went to Carefree, Arizona, to pay a visit to a new friend he'd made during the time he was inverted, a friend he was willing to \"help\", Sam Alexander aka Nova. Cletus left a message signaling his return in the form of murdering a random bystander who he had asked where to find the boy as proof that he was reverted to his natural moral axis.<\/p><p>After learning that Sam's mother worked at a local diner, Cletus took her hostage there in order to get his attention, but, tired of waiting, Cletus decided to kill her. Nova arrived before he could do so and took him away from the diner to an empty area in order not to hurt anyone. While fighting, Nova tried to convince him that he wasn't Sam Alexander, but Cletus didn't believe him. After being wounded by the Nova Force, Cletus fled to let his symbiote heal him as the police arrived. The next day, already healed from his burns, Cletus attacked Sam again, this time at his school. While attacking Sam, Carnage saw Nova flying around the area, thus making it impossible for the boy to be Nova (unbeknownst to him, that was Sam's mother wearing his helmet). Enraged, Carnage followed the false Nova, but lost sight of her. He then started to attack innocent people to try and get Nova's attention, provoking a new battle between them.Carnage was taken by Nova to the sky and then punched into the parking lot below, the impact setting off the cars' alarms, dizzying Cletus and his symbiote. Cletus was then thrown by Nova, who had already realized Carnage's weakness to loud sounds, into an Anthrax (a heavy metal band which Cletus was a fan of) show nearby. As the symbiote screamed in pain, Cletus fled to the road, but was attacked by Nova again. He threw a car at Nova, who caught it midair, and took advantage of it to punch him. As he was about to finish his opponent off, Carnage was hit by a truck. He was then tied in metal plates by Nova, and left by his symbiote as he revealed he wanted to kill Nova because he wanted to erase any memory of his good deeds from the time he had his moral axis inverted from anyone who remembered it. He was left by Sam in Ryker's<a title=\"Ryker's Island\" href=\"https:\/\/marvel.fandom.com\/wiki\/Ryker%27s_Island\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Island<\/a>.<\/p><h3>The Darkhold<\/h3><p>Having escaped from Rykers, Carnage was lured to Grey Ridge Mine in West Virginia by the FBI upon learning its chief of security, Manuela Calderon, was the sole survivor of Kasady's first mass murder. A task force that included FBI agent Clarie Dixon, Army soldier John Jameson (aka Man-Wolf) and Eddie Brock (the latest host of the Toxin symbiote) attempted to capture Carnage, but the plan fell apart when Carnage and several FBI agents fell through a fracture into a played-out section of the mine, an occurrence set up by the owner of the mine, Barry Gleason, who turned out to be a member of the occult group known as the Darkholders. Gleason lured Carnage deeper into the mine until he reached a secret temple, where Gleason and the Darkholders attempted to sacrifice Carnage in a ritual that involved the Darkhold, a book of ancient times that made reference to Carnage as the \"Red Slayer.\" The ritual resulted in the unexpected enhancement of Carnage's powers, prompting Kasady to take the Darkhold with him when he slip away from the FBI's task force.<\/p><p>Carnage would soon make his way to an uncharted island where he could unlock the Darkhold's powers. On his way there, he hijacked a freighter a group of Darkholders planned to use to bring Carnage to said island, and learned in the process the Darkhold's connection to Elder God Chthon. The FBI's task force followed him to the ship, now joined by Darkhold expert Victoria Montesi, and tried to stop him. Carnage used the Darkhold on Claire Dixon, turning her into his own symbiote-possessed puppet named Raze. In an attempt to destroy Carnage, Raze and the Darkhold, the task force blew up the freighter. Carnage survived, and was found adrift at sea by young sailor Jubulile van Scotter. Carnage infected Jubulile with a symbiote, which created a psychic connection between the two, but she managed to escape and was later found by the anti-Carnage task force.<\/p><p>Once he reached the island and reunited with Raze, Carnage delved deeper into its territory until he found the Chthonic temple and the altar. He performed a ritual that summoned Chthon to the world with the intention to destroy it. Kasady attempted to have Chthon reward him with more power, but failed. Having tracked down Carnage to the island and subsequently the temple, the task force confronted him. Chthon was confronted by Jubulile, who was empowered by her symbiote, the Toxin symbiote absorbed from Brock, and the Raze symbiote absorbed from Dixon. Jubulile was given more power when Montesi took the Darkhold from Carnage and fed her psychic energies from all over the world, allowing her to become powerful enough to banish Chthon. Montesi also used the Darkhold on Carnage, casting a spell that stripped Kasady of his symbiote and reshaped it into a cage that detained him. The members of the task force later parted ways, with Calderon and Jameson deciding to deliver Kasady to the FBI.<\/p><p>Kasady was subsequently stripped of the Carnage symbiote, with it having been kept separate from him at the Lock Box before being stolen and delivered to Norman Osborn. Osborn ultimately ripped the Carnage symbiote off when he realized that Cletus would get the credit if he killed Spider-Man while bonded to it, but the symbiote installed a copy of Cletus' psyche into Osborn's mind when it was killed in the process of bonding to him, giving him a new split personality.<\/p><h3>The Poison Invasion<\/h3><p>Kasady was re-incarcerated in Ravencroft, placed in a specialized cell that kept him immobilized and suspended off the ground. When the Poison Hive attacked Earth-616, Kasady was approached by Poisoned incarnations of Morbius, Kraven the Hunter, and Lady Deathstrike, who mocked how pathetic he was without the Carnage symbiote or his legs. Pleased that Kasady's insatiable bloodlust was intact, the Poisons brought him onboard their flagship and offered him the chance to become Carnage again if he allied with them. Kasady - unaware that the Poisons intended to consume him before he became a threat and use the ensuing Poison Carnage as a weapon of mass destruction - eagerly accepted, believing they would return his beloved symbiote to him. He was instead used as a test subject and forcibly bonded a new symbiote that the remnants of the Carnage symbiote in his blood attempted to reject, causing him excruciating pain in the process. Upon breaking free, he began to rampage but was quickly consumed by an unbound Poison. Despite Poison Doom's precautions, Cletus' psyche was able to mostly-resist being consumed, and Poison Carnage only pretended to be loyal to the Hive. He attacked Alchemax alongside Poison Doctor Druid, Poison Killer Thrill, the Poison X-Force, and Poison Thundra; but was angered when informed their mission wasn't to fight but to bolster the Hive's ranks.<\/p><p>Poison Carnage threatened Poison Doctor Druid into teleporting him and the other Poisons back to their ship. Once there, Poison Carnage battled both Venom and Spider-Man, nearly decapitating the former and impaling the latter. He was ultimately tossed into space by Venom and Danger.<\/p><h3>Prophet of the Void<\/h3><p>After the Poison Queen's death, Poison Carnage's crystalline exoskeleton and consumed symbiote crumbled to reveal Cletus Kasady somehow restored to humanity. As gravity took hold of Cletus, the remnants of the original Carnage symbiote emerged in an attempt to shield his body from the reentry plasma but perished despite its <i>Darkhold<\/i>-augmentations, leaving him badly burnt. Cletus crash-landed in the desert and died from his severe injuries, his body being recovered and ID'd by authorities.<\/p><p>The Cult of Knull, an apocalyptic cult dedicated to worshiping Knull and led by a corrupted Scorn, attacked the convoy transporting Cletus' body to retrieve it, and later stole a sample of the primordial Grendel symbiote from the Maker's Project Oversight laboratory. Scorn bonded the piece of the Grendel symbiote to Cletus, intending to turn him into Knull's new vessel. Reanimated by the primordial symbiote, Cletus was psychically connected to the dark god, fighting against his will for control of his now-undead body. Cletus' connection to Knull was broken when he ripped out Scorn's spine to consume the trace remnants - or codex - of the Carnage symbiote left over from her time as its host and consumed it. Altering the piece of the Grendel symbiote to match the appearance of the Carnage symbiote, Cletus decided to help free Knull and set out to hunt down and consume the codices of the other symbiote hosts, living and deceased. Assuming leadership of the cult, Carnage subsequently conquered San Francisco's underground city -- which Venom had once guarded as the Lethal Protector -- and used his newfound abilities to infect the inhabitants with symbiote \"brain worms\" - maggots infected with the Carnagized Grendel symbiote - sending them to hunt down those who possessed symbiote codices.<\/p><p>Recruiting Shriek and Doppelganger once more, Carnage returned to Doverton, Colorado and claimed the codices of the Carnage symbiote left in its populace; infecting John Jameson with the Carnagized Grendel symbiote so that he could act as a sleeper agent. Carnage -- now sporting Knull's spiral emblem on his forehead -- traveled to Philadelphia to claim Andi Benton's symbiote codex, killing her aunt Sarah and the Monsters of Evil, though Andi used the demonic powers of her Hell-Markto escape. Carnage returned to Manhattan, but during the War of the Realms he opted to sit out the combat and chaos rather than reveal himself prematurely; establishing a lair in the sewers and subways under Grand Street, and infecting more homeless people and animals with the Carnageized Grendel symbiote to act as his minions. After the war's end, Carnage began sending his minions out to hunt for codices, and resurrected Emil Gregg to torment Eddie. Carnage and his followers also exhumed the bodies of every deceased people who'd bonded to a symbiote, harvested their codices, and left the desecrated bodies in a mass grave in the shape of Knull's spiral.<\/p><p>Greatly empowered, Kasady was transformed into \"Dark Carnage\" -- a thirteen foot-tall skeletal monster with Knull's spiral on its forehead and a white dragon\/spider emblem on his chest. Harvesting the codices of the Weapon V super-soldier program and Leonard Elkhart, a one-time host of the Venom symbiote, Dark Carnage traveled to Nicaragua and attacked Alejandra Jones, whose Spirit of Vengeance had at one point melded with the Venom symbiote and transferred a codex into her. Despite interference from another Ghost Rider, Danny Ketch, Dark Carnage ripped out Alejandra's spine and ate it, temporarily absorbing her Spirit of Vengeance. Delighting in his new demonic powers, Dark Carnage battled Ketch but was retrieved by his followers when they started to fade. Chastised for losing sight of the cult's goals, Dark Carnage lashed out at them before resuming the hunt for codices.<\/p><p>Upon arriving in Manhattan, Dark Carnage attempted to break into the old Avengers Tower, impersonating Eddie Brock and allowing himself to be arrested. Kasady informed the police of his resurrection and plan to unleash Knull in such a way as to make Brock look like a raving lunatic, and was imprisoned in Ryker's Island. Still posing as Brock, Kasady was confronted by Lee Price - who had formerly hosted the Venom symbiote and was currently the host of the Mania symbiote - in the prison cafeteria. When Price threatened him, Kasady ripped the Mania symbiote out of him and bonded to it, destroying the security cameras in order to frame Brock. Transforming into Dark Carnage, Kasady slaughtered the inmates in the cafeteria and broke out of the prison; making his way to the mainland and selecting Spider-Man as his next target.<\/p><p>Noticing Eddie Brock and his son Dylan, Cletus pursued them into the subway and pushed Eddie and Dylan in front of an oncoming train - in mockery of what Eddie had once done to Spider-Man. The Venom symbiote rebonded to Eddie and derailed the train to save him and Dylan, and Cletus transformed into Dark Carnage; laughing off Venom's attacks and attempting to rip the Venom symbiote off Eddie so that he could absorb it. Eddie managed to incapacitate Dark Carnage by grabbing onto the third rail - exploiting the Carnagized Grendel symbiote's vulnerability to electricity - but Cletus quickly recovered. Setting his sights on Norman Osborn, Cletus made his way to Ravencroft and activated John Jameson to keep Spider-Man and Venom - who has shown up to protect Osborn - occupied. Cletus infected the inmates with the Carnagized Grendel symbiote - turning them into four-armed red-and-black monsters resembling the Doppelganger - and sicced his army on Spider-Man and Venom before throwing Spider-Man through the door of Osborn's cell. Amused by Osborn believing himself to be Cletus Kasady, Dark Carnage bonded him to the Carnageized Grendel symbiote and turned him into a duplicate of his original Carnage form - much like what Norman himself had done with his grandson, Normie Osborn, to transform him into the Goblin Childe.<\/p><p>Taking over the asylum and indoctrinating the inmates into his cult, Dark Carnage claimed Shriek's codex and resurrected Demogoblin using her corpse as a vessel. After Deadpool interrupted the cult's gathering and burned down Ravencroft, Kasady marked him as a priority target due to him having the codex of the Hybrid symbiote. Growing increasingly annoyed by Osborn's delusion of being Cletus Kasady, Dark Carnage returned to his lair underneath Grand Street and unleashed his horde on the city: sending the symbiote-doppelgangers to rampage and flush out former hosts in-hiding; \"Demagoblin\" and Man-Wolf after Misty Knight; the Knull-corrupted Riot, Agony, Phage, and Lasher after Normie to claim his Carnage codex; and Osborn after the Scorpion to claim his Venom and Mania codices; and the resurrected Knull-corrupted Scream after Andi Benton to claim her Mania codex. He also sent Will o' the Wisp, Conundrum and Freak after Deadpool, with Osborn arriving soon after. When Scream betrayed him, Dark Carnage personally killed its host - Patricia Robertson - though the Scream symbiote transferred to Andi Benton, who escaped.<\/p><p>Again disguising himself as Eddie Brock, Dark Carnage snuck into the warehouse where Eddie, Spider-Man, and a number of other former symbiote hosts were hiding in to use a machine called the S.C.I.T.H.E, which could non-fatally remove codices. Approached by Spider-Man, who fell for his disguise, Cletus learned that Dylan Brock was Eddie's son. When the real Eddie arrived, accidentally revealing that Spider-Man was Peter Parker, Dark Carnage unveiled himself and summoned a horde of Carnage Doppelgangers to attack the warehouse. The Venom symbiote, tired of Eddie's refusal to face Dark Carnage for fear of orphaning Dylan, decided to bond with Bruce Banner, though Carnage killed him in the middle of it. However, as Dark Carnage had no idea who Banner was, he was shocked when Banner resurrected as the Savage Hulk and completed the bonding, delivering a powerful blow that he actually felt.<\/p><p>As they battled, Dark Carnage sensed the One Below All's power and wondered what would happen if he forced open the Green Door and merged it with Knull's eldritch darkness; though the Venomized Hulk rebuked his offer of an alliance. Stabbing tendrils into the Hulk's brain, Dark Carnage forced him to revert into Bruce Banner and then ripped the Venom symbiote off of him. Assimilating it, Dark Carnage transformed into an even more powerful form sporting draconic wings and horns, and pauldrons and arm-wraps resembling Knull's. With the Carnageized Grendel symbiote now powerful enough to free Knull from his prison, Dark Carnage took off; pursued by Eddie Brock - who had merged the codices harvested using the S.C.I.T.H.E. into a duplicate of the Venom symbiote.<\/p><p>As they fought in midair and on the rooftops, Dark Carnage gloated that he was on the cusp of victory and could see his horde about to kill Eddie's allies, telling Eddie to give up and let himself be consumed. Caught off-guard by the sudden arrival of Cloak, Dagger, Iron Fist, Firestar, Morbius, Deathlok, Captain Marvel, Deadpool, and Scream turning the tables; Dark Carnage was tackled through the ground and into the tunnel where Dylan Brock and Normie Osborn were hiding.<\/p><p>Snaring Dylan, Dark Carnage mockingly told Eddie that he had tricked him into claiming the remaining codices and that he now faced a decision in which both choices -- letting Dark Carnage kill Dylan or killing Dark Carnage to save Dylan -- would lead to Knull reawakening. Manifesting a Necrosword from his symbiote, Eddie impaled Dark Carnage before cutting him in half, Cletus' corpse falling apart as the merged Grendel and Venom symbiotes left him for Eddie.<\/p><h3>Posthumous Activities<\/h3><p>Despite the death of his physical body, Cletus' consciousness was apparently preserved within the Symbiote Hive-Mind via his codex, enabling him to posthumously control the Grendel symbiote's offshoot. When the Carnage-ized Grendel symbiote bonded to Eddie Brock, Cletus dragged Eddie's consciousness into the Hive-Mind and tormented him with nightmares of his worst fears come to life, intending to control his body and use it to pick up where he'd left off.<\/p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<\/h2><p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Carnage_%28Symbiote%29_%28Earth-616%29\" rel=\"nofollow \">symbiote<\/a> of which Cletus Kasady is a host to provides him with various superhuman powers as a result of bonding with the symbiote. Most of Carnage\u2019s powers are similar to those possessed by Spider-Man and Venom, though a few are more developed, as Venom, explained, the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor as a result of it being gestated and it\u2019s incubations in an alien environment to it such as the Earth environment as well as the maniacal will and insane worldview that Cletus Kasady has had from the age of 8 years old onward. Spider-Man has always needed help in fighting Carnage, Fighting Spider-Man and Venom at the same time. Kasady possesses various superhuman attributes as a result of bonding with the Carnage symbiote. Most of his powers are similar to those possessed by Spider-Man and Venom, however some of his powers are unique only to himself. For example Carnage can see out of every bit of his symbiote. If the Venom symbiote was linked to Brock in the nervous system, the merger of Cletus and his symbiote was effected down to a cellular level, linking human blood cells and symbiote cells. With the symbiote bonded to his bloodstream and it becoming a part of him, not only can the symbiote not be separated from Kasady by traditional means, but it\u2019s been shown that the Carnage\u2019s symbiote can also hide in Cletus Kasady\u2019s blood stream and that it even caused a mutation in Cletus Kasady\u2019s blood so that when the symbiote was seemingly destroyed, Cletus Kasady can \"regenerate\" his symbiote costume from scratch by simply bleeding. One drop of blood would be all it takes to strengthen the alien. However, that diminished later on as the symbiote could be separated from its host and leave him powerless.<\/p><p>When Kasady is a host to the <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Carnage_%28Symbiote%29_%28Earth-616%29\" rel=\"nofollow \">symbiote<\/a>, Carnage possesses a great amount of physical superhuman strength as originally he was strong enough to physical lift about 50 tons of weight as he has demonstrated being stronger than both Spider-Man and Venom combined. As of right now, Carnage can physical lift about <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Strength_Scale%20\/%2050\" rel=\"nofollow \">80 tons<\/a> of weight. Carnage\u2019s superhumanly strong legs allow him to run and move at speeds that are greater and superior to that of the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete and Carnage has stated that he is more than ten times faster than normal humans. Carnage\u2019s reflexes, agility, balance,reaction time, and bodily coordination, are all enhanced to a level that is far beyond and far superior to that of the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete and are even superior to Spider-Man\u2019s making him sufficient enough to dodge gun fire.<\/p><p>Carnage can fight, run, and perform other physical activities that will allow him to physically exert himself at peak capacity for about 24 hours on end before the build up of fatigue toxins in his bloodstream begins to impair him and affect his overall capabilities. Carnage can withstand high caliber bullets, falls from a great height of over several stories, enough volts to fry a normal human in seconds and powerful energy attacks while sustaining little to no pain or physical injury as well as also withstanding powerful impact forces and blunt force trauma from direct physical blows from superhumans as strong as Spider-Man, Venom, or Toxin with far less physical injury than that of what would instantly kill normal humans or what lower level super humans would receive.<\/p><p>Carnage is able to rapidly regenerate and heal damaged bodily tissues with much greater speed and efficiency than that of what normal humans are capable of allowing him to regenerate and heal from large amounts of damaged or even destroyed bodily tissue that would be fatal to normal humans within a matter of moments. Carnage\u2019s symbiote has even shown the ability to repair brain damage, as it had done for both the Wizard and Cletus Kasady himself. Carnage can fully regenerate severed limbs or missing internal organs although he has appeared to have regrown the lower half of his body and while in the Microverse, Carnage was capable of reattaching his severed head after being decapitated by Venom. However, should Cletus Kasady lose his limbs and not be able to heal them, the symbiote can also replace them by forming legs of its own as long as Cletus Kasady has his <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Carnage_%28Symbiote%29_%28Earth-616%29\" rel=\"nofollow \">symbiote<\/a>. Carnage\u2019s regenerative healing factor extends to his immune system as well rendering him to be immune to the effects of all known Earthly diseases, infections and illnesses that even current human medical care cannot care such as cancer as long as Kasady remains bonded with the symbiote.<\/p><p>Like with all symbiotes, Carnage possesses limited shape-shifting abilities which Kasady has full control over the size, shape, color (usually red and black), texture, and hardness of his symbiote (and any part thereof) and can use it in a verity of ways including:<\/p><p>Like Venom, the symbiote possesses limited shape-shifting abilities in the sense that it is capable of immediately mimicking the appearance and texture of any form of normal clothing, or garment that Kasady wishes (which he has done on rare occasion), as well as camouflaging with its surrounding environment rendering himself almost invisible.<\/p><p>Carnage can generate tentacle-like appendages from various parts of his body and warp his appendages into different arms, legs, and even wings, which he often uses either in combat situations or to restrain someone and can also use the same substance comprising the symbiote in the form of constituent red matter or goo, and uses it in this method for lethal force against criminals. Carnage can send a part of the symbiote and direct its movements into a victim's body, smothering them from the inside. It can also convert ingested organic materials such as flesh and blood into additional biomass. While in small American town of Doverton, Colorado, Kasady was able to vastly increase the symbiote\u2019s size and mass by consuming all the meat of over four thousand head of cattle and the staff in the local meat packing factory making symbiote copes.<\/p><p>Carnage can morph sections of his body, such as his hands or feet, into bladed weaponry and blunt instruments such as spikes, blades, shields, swords, giant talons, harmers or claws, or axes from his own mass and using them to stab or shred any innocent person he sees. This is shown on several occasions when Carnage mutates his fingers and arms into what look like large swords. Unlike Venom, Carnage can also detach parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of solid weapons such as darts, spears, knives, axes, etc., if he chooses to. For example, Carnage has often forms spikes that he expels from his body. Whatever the weaponry, however, they will disintegrate into dust after being separated from his body after a period of about 30 seconds after leaving Carnage\u2018s body. Carnage has also shown being able to infect others, taking over their body against their will. After consuming all the meat of over four thousand head of cattle and the staff in the local meat packing factory in small American town. Carnage almost took over a small town including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/captain-america\/4005-1442\/\">Captain America<\/a>, the Thing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/wolverine\/4005-1440\/\">Wolverine<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/hawkeye\/4005-1475\/\">Hawkeye<\/a> all becoming infected with the bloodthirsty symbiote copes after increasing it\u2019s size, and all being used as puppets against Spider-Man.<\/p><p>The symbiote is also able to rapidly adapt itself and its host to new environments. Carnage is capable of surviving in harmful areas for long periods of time such as being underwater or in toxic gases, by having the symbiote filter breathable air for Kasady and when Kasady was taken into space by Sentry, the symbiote was able to save his life by growing small sacks around his mouth that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, allowing Kasady to stay alive long enough for him to be recovered.<\/p><p>Although it's widely known that the Symbiote can stretch and deform itself, recently it was able to perform this ability during bonded with a human host allowing Carnage to be able to stretch his limbs and once sent his symbiote costume through a telephone line by reducing it to a cellular level. After consuming all the meat of over four thousand head of cattle and the staff in the local meat packing factory in a small town. Carnage was able to infect the town by making the symbiote find its way through the sinks and drains.<\/p><p>Like with all symbiotes, Carnage possesses certain telepathic abilities as it enables him to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tendril\" rel=\"nofollow \">tendril<\/a>. In <i>Carnage: Mind Bomb<\/i>, a psychiatric specialist named Matthew Kurtz attempted to treat Carnage. Thinking he has Kasady under control, Kurtz ends up having a symbiote tendril drilled in his head. Kasady then proceeds to pump mental images into Kurtz's mind to show him how he sees the world. As a result: Matthew Kurtz is driven mad and runs amok only to be gunned down by Ravencroft guards.<\/p><p>Symbiotes have a genetic memory, allowing them to exploit their parents' knowledge through ancestral recall. Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, Carnage remembered and felt the trauma of <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Galactus_%28Earth-616%29\" rel=\"nofollow \">Galactus<\/a> devouring a word populated by symbiotes.<\/p><p>The Carnage symbiote is capable of psychically detecting and tracking its offspring, however with effort this ability can be blocked So that Venom can\u2019t track him.<\/p><p>Due to being Venom\u2019s son, Carnage possesses other powers that are common with Spider-Man<\/p><p>Much like Spider-Man and Venom, Carnage has the ability to cling to virtually any surface by controlling the flux of inter-atomic attraction between molecular boundary layers. Carnage can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slickened surfaces.<\/p><p>Carnage can shoot strands of the alien\u2019s substance in the form of webbing. Carnage can project this powerful, organic web-like substance similar to the webbing Spider-Man has which at high pressure can reach up to a distance of over 70 feet (21.336 meters) and the strands possess the tensile strength of over 125 pounds per square millimeter of cross section. Carnage typically uses this webbing to swing from building to building or as a means of immobilizing someone. The webbing is exceptionally strong, much more so for even the finest normal human athlete to break.<\/p><p>Carnage also possesses an extrasensory ability similar to Spider-Man\u2019s spider-sense. This response is not as complicated as Spider-Man\u2019s inherent sense since the alien costume can detect danger from every direction or angle and conduct Kasady in plenty of time for incoming threats. It's a lot more efficient than Spider-Man\u2019s spider-sense because it takes less time to sense the danger, and Kasady\u2019s reflexes are faster than Spider-Man\u2019s, because they are enhanced by the alien costume for instance Carnage can dodge a gunshot or a barrage of bullets.<\/p><p>Due to the Carnage symbiote being a child of the Venom symbiote which Spider-Man was its first host, Carnage can't be detected by Spider-Man's sixth sense, his Spider-Sense. As such, Carnage is capable of attacking Spider-Man without alerting him, making Carnage a deadly foe.<\/p><p>In some interpretations, the Carnage symbiote is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vampire\" rel=\"nofollow \">vampiric<\/a>, feeding on and thus endangering his victims by mere touch. If Venom is a symbiote with a limited mass, Carnage on the contrary, constantly forms new molecules and so has inexhaustible reserves it finds in its victims, like a vampire, feeding on them with mere touch.<\/p><p>Cletus Kasady is a Schizophrenic enabling him to activate extra-terrestrial episodes of paranoia and delusion to transform into the demonic alien symbiote of Carnage, converting negative emotions into biomass. It would also seem that when Carnage consumes or eats other symbiotes as he did in Planet of the Symbiotes storyline, Carnage would grow in size, growing gigantic as he devoured so many symbiotes, that his height grew up to 100 feet.<\/p><p>The symbiote has also shown the ability to call back parts of itself back to the main symbiote, adding it to the parts that already make up the symbiote. It can also send commands that cannot be resisted to parts of itself that are in technology, used to break the bones of the Iron Rangers when they challenged Carnage while wearing symbiote enhanced technological exo-suits. Using these last two abilities, Carnage absorbed the five Iron Rangers, and consequently grew to an enormous size and assumed the color blue.<\/p><p>Following being experimented on by Hall Industries, the symbiote developed the ability to create duplicates of itself that could be controlled by its main body.<\/p><p>Though he has had no formal training, the natural abilities granted to Kasady by the symbiote along with Carnage's homicidal urges make him an erratic and dangerous opponent who\u2019s highly erratic and unpredictable. Even without the symbiote, Kasady is capable of killing people without hesitation.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2270197\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.61241319444444\" data-width=\"2304\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2304px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2270197\"><img alt=\"The Carnage symbiote destroyed by extreme sound, leaving Cletus Kasady naked &amp; unconscious \" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg 2304w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Carnage symbiote destroyed by extreme sound, leaving Cletus Kasady naked &amp; unconscious \" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg 2304w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11136\/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Carnage symbiote destroyed by extreme sound, leaving Cletus Kasady naked &amp; unconscious <\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Weaknesses<\/strong><\/p><p>The Carnage symbiote, like all others of its kind, is extremely vulnerable to both extreme heat (to a much greater degree than Venom) and sonic (to a much lesser degree than Venom) based attacks. They can cause the symbiote physical pain and discomfort, where as \"more powerful\" attacks might be completely ineffective, however Carnage doesn't mind the heat as long as he's the one making it as he has made a camp fire.<\/p><p>Without his symbiote. Kasady is just a normal human. However, the degree of fusion of Cletus Kasady and his symbiote is such that he has become physically dependent on the symbiote. Thus, when the symbiote merged with Ben Reilly, Cletus Kasady began aging fast and early as his body was rapidly deteriorating, being incapable doing the simplest actions such as operating a sink. Once the symbiote returned, Cletus found health. Subsequently, it appeared that this weakening of Cletus was linked to a stomach cancer which was held in check by the actions of the symbiote (as in the case of cancer Venom and Brock ) once the symbiote was fully treated, the cancer Cletus had, Cletus Kasady could survive without his symbiote, which is shown when Venom eventually absorb it.<\/p><p>Cletus Kasady has been diagnosed with a severe mental illness called schizophrenia. Even without the symbiote, Cletus had insanity from his criminal ways.<\/p><p>Due to a recent run in with the <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Peter_Parker_%28Kaine%29_%28Earth-616%29\" rel=\"nofollow \">Scarlet Spider<\/a>.

The result was, initially, a stabilised clone of a human as a fetus, but then quickly developed and mutated, escaping the confines of the lab. However, it had to drain all fluid from its victims to stay alive, due to the fact that the DNA of the creature was severely damaged, explaining how it looked so dramatically different from the individuals that it was cloned from. When Carnage escapes from the lab it begins making its way towards Peter Parker's home. In it's wake it leaves a trail of corpses that have been completely drained of their blood. Upon finally confronting Peter Parker, it begins to take a new shape, revealing a face that is not unlike Peter himself. After escaping, Peter figured out that the creature was, essentially, unstable, and was looking for a host that was compatible with the Parker genes that it was created with: absorbing Peter would in theory make the clone complete as the missing fragments of DNA would be restored.<\/p><p>Peter then battles Carnage and eventually tricks the being into throwing itself down a smoke stack into the fire below. While Peter was happy that the rampage was over, he lamented that in the end, it was just a confused and scared clone that ultimately just wanted to live, but in the end Peter reasoned that it was essentially nothing more than a mindless creature without a brain, through this was implied to not be the case (as the Carnage creature could recall Peter's memories and seemed to be capable of reasoning, through to a very limited extent). Carnage is not seen again until one of its victims, Peter Parker's friend <a href=\"\/gwen-stacy\/4005-1480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy<\/a> is found alive again.<\/p><p>With her reappearance, a series of Peter Parker clones appear. <a href=\"\/nick-fury\/4005-3202\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury<\/a> mobilizes the <a href=\"\/spider-slayer\/4005-15512\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15512\">Spider Slayers<\/a> to bring the situation under control and in the confrontation, the new Gwen Stacy reverts into Carnage and is shot by the Spider Slayers. This was ultimately uncovered as a CIA project done with leftover Carnage samples, nicknamed \"The Stacy Project\" in which Ben Reily (Connors assistant) and Octavius created multiple clones by infusing the Carnage symbote with Gwen's DNA, creating a far more stable clone of her that could also mutate into a form not unlike Carnage at will, through she struggled to control it properly. This power would be removed after the Stacy clone (while in Carnage form) would attack Venom, resulting in both of them combining. This would leave the Stacy clone perfectly intact but without the symbote, while Venom would mutate further and grow stronger as a result of the absorption.<\/p><h3>Earth-15<\/h3><p>An alternate reality where following discovery that Chameleon had being manipulating him with robotic versions of his parents.

He was generally rude and very much disliked the team leader, <a href=\"\/sabretooth\/4005-4563\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\">Sabretooth<\/a>.<\/p><p>When Spider and Weapon X arrived on the home universe of <a href=\"\/david-richards\/4005-59369\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59369\">David Richards<\/a> (an alternate version of the villain called Hyperstorm), he noticed that the <a href=\"\/exiles\/4060-19986\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19986\">Exiles<\/a> had arrived there as well. Unlike those who comprised The Exiles, Spider was not shocked to discover that there was another reality hopping team like Weapon X, though he was surprised to learn that <a href=\"\/sasquatch\/4005-1478\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1478\">Sasquatch<\/a> was a woman named <a href=\"\/heather-hudson\/4005-9846\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9846\">Heather Hudson<\/a>. He had no problem showing his identity as Peter Parker, as he was seen moving around without a mask. Spider helped the Exiles with rescuing this kid named David Richards. After they rescued the boy and all of the other children, Sabretooth was having a fight with <a href=\"\/deadpool\/4005-7606\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool<\/a> about killing David Richards. Spider told everybody that both teams will stay if they don't kill David Richards and it would be their best interest to kill him and get on with everyone's lives. When Sabretooth abandoned the team and killed Deadpool, Spider ordered the rest of Weapon X to kill him, which quickly erupted into an all-out battle between Weapon X and The Exiles. It was then that The Timebroker appeared, hoping to end the conflict, only to be assaulted by Spider. However, <a href=\"\/mimic\/4005-12546\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12546\">Mimic<\/a> managed to halt Spider's attack before Spider could \"kill\" him. The Exiles then proposed a compromise; Sabretooth was to stay and raise David Richards in the hopes that he could prevent him from becoming another Hyperstorm and both teams move on with their missions.<\/p><p>An alternate reality <a href=\"\/gambit\/4005-1499\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\">Gambit<\/a> was made the new leader of Weapon X, something that did not please Spider at all. Spider's next big mission was in reality where <a href=\"\/iron-man\/4005-1455\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man<\/a> ruled as a dictator. Their mission was to help Iron Man in destroying the <a href=\"\/inhumans\/4060-11427\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans<\/a>. The problem was that Attilan was protected by an energy shield and the only key to penetrate it was in the hands of <a href=\"\/wonder-man\/4005-1465\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man<\/a>. But the Wonder Man of this reality was far different from any other incarnation they might have encountered before, he had absorbed gamma particles when Hulk died and his strength grew enormously. Weapon X infiltrated his mansion and planed to steal the device to lower Inhumans' shield, but were discovered. A fight quickly broke loose; Spider thought to convince Wonder Man to surrender by threatening <a href=\"\/scarlet-witch\/4005-1466\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch<\/a>, his wife. That however made Wonder Man angry, and he Hulked-out. Now seeing no other option, Gambit activated portable <a href=\"\/the-negative-zone\/4020-40699\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\">Negative Zone<\/a> portal. When Wonder Man still hanged on, Gambit ordered <a href=\"\/she-hulk\/4005-1449\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk<\/a> to push him in, reassuring that Spider will toss her a web. Spider however refused to do so, and both Hulks disappeared into to portal. When Gambit lashed out at him for abandoning She-Hulk, Spider defended himself by saying that the combined weight of She-Hulk and the hulked-out Wonder Man would have resulted in him being dragged into The Negative Zone as well. Spider also pointed out that it was Gambit, not he, who had promised to cast She-Hulk a lifeline. Following Spiders explanation, a new member arrived to take She-Hulk's place, namely <a href=\"\/colossus\/4005-1460\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus<\/a>, but the time for mixing and mingling would have to wait for they had a job to do. After handing the device over to Iron Man, they supervised the attack on The Inhumans, but did not see the trap that had been prepared for their arrival until it was too late. However, before any harm could come to them, Spider and his teammates were spirited away to another reality.<\/p><p>Sometime later on one specific mission to kill <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Bruce Banner<\/a>, where Spider had been placed in charge of keeping the soldiers from entering the facility while <a href=\"\/ms-marvel\/4005-21561\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Ms. Marvel<\/a> (who had replaced The Angel at some point during their journey) proceeded with killing Bruce Banner. Colossus protested against the killings and wanted to seek other options to complete the missions. Spider and Colossus began to argue over their way of doing things but both were stopped by The Vision, who ended the debate once and for all by stating that killing their targets was the only way to ensure that they truly completed their missions. As this occurred Gambit was comforting <a href=\"\/storm\/4005-1444\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm<\/a>; who had been mortally wounded during an earlier fight, and was desperately trying to keep her alive. But she soon gave into the darkness and with her last breath, asked to be buried in a forest and not left behind in the factory amongst those they had killed. With the crunch of Banner's skull, Weapon X was then spirited away to another reality to complete yet another mission, apparently leaving Storm to rot in the factory, not that Spider or anyone else other than Gambit cared.<\/p><p>Upon arriving in a ruined version of The Xavier Institute, Spider and Weapon X found their newest member, <a href=\"\/king-hyperion\/4005-62056\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62056\">King Hyperion<\/a>, waiting for them. Their new assignment was to kill the last ten Mutants who managed to survive the Mutant Holocaust instigated by an army of Sentinels under the control of The United Nations. Hyperion opposed those orders and wanted to rule the world instead, a proclamation that made even Spider take a minute to think about. Spider then spoke up and asked if he would be allowed to kill ten humans, Hyperion said that he could kill as many as he wanted so long as he remained loyal. Spider immediately sided with Hyperion and became very attached to the ex-God Emperor. Together they tried to convince the mutants of that reality to side with Hyperion and aid him in conquering the world, but most of them refused. It was only after the deaths of <a href=\"\/wolverine\/4005-1440\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine<\/a>, <a href=\"\/mystique\/4005-1469\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique<\/a> and <a href=\"\/magneto\/4005-1441\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto<\/a> that everyone including a reluctant Storm agreed to join Hyperion in his quest to conquer the world. There was a minor problem though, Magneto had sent a massive asteroid to Earth a few hours prior to his encounter with Hyperion and had refused to stop it even after being tortured by Hyperion. Despite Hyperion's attempts to halt the asteroid's descent, he failed and the Earth died. With Earth dead, Hyperion saw that it was pointless to remain in that reality and began systematically killing all of the Mutants off. Spider managed to strike <a href=\"\/vanisher\/4005-6756\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6756\">Vanisher<\/a> through the heart and was attacked by Gambit who, along with Storm, teleported to another side of Asteroid M with the dying Vanisher.<\/p><p>Spider later reappeared at Hyperion's side, opposite of Ms. Marvel, along with the two newest additions to Weapon X: <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">The Hulk<\/a> and <a href=\"\/firestar\/4005-2101\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\">Firestar<\/a> and commended Gambit for \"seeing the light.\" As their journey progressed, Gambit started to lie to Hyperion about the mission objectives and tricked him into thinking that the worlds they had traveled to were not worth conquering thus compelling them to complete the missions. But Hyperion eventually caught on and blasted Gambit's arm off with his atomic heat vision in an attempt to take The Tallus for himself. When The Hulk tried to kill Hyperion, Spider managed to latch a web onto his arm and pulled his attention away from Hyperion long enough for the madman to recover. With Spider and Ms. Marvel's aid, Hyperion overwhelmed the two and then moved onto bigger targets like The Fantastic Five and The Avengers. Spider later built a large web in Times Square from which the corpses of Earth-4400's heroes and the semi-conscious Hulk and Firestar were strung up on for all to see and was then sent on a reconnaissance mission to find The Exiles. When The Exiles appeared, Spider rushed back to Hyperion's side and told him of their arrival. Later, when he learned that only six survivors would be allowed to move onto the next reality, Spider tried to kill Firestar despite Hyperion's protests and was incinerated. His ashes along with the corpses of Magik, Ms. Marvel, Firestar, Hulk and Hyperion were brought to The Panoptichron and sealed away inside a wall of crystal containing the bodies of every Weapon X and Exile member who had ever died or been rendered comatose such as Heather Hudson, Thunderbird and, surprisingly enough, King Hyperion).<\/p><p>When Exiles discovered that the bodies can be released from the crystal wall, they sent all of them back to their own reality. Spider's body was buried in the prison graveyard.<\/p><h3>Earth-985<\/h3><p>In this reality the Carnage symbiote bonded with <a href=\"\/silver-surfer\/4005-2502\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer<\/a>. The Surfer fought Spider-Man, the <a href=\"\/avengers\/4060-3806\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers<\/a> and <a href=\"\/firestar\/4005-2101\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\">Firestar.<\/a> When she managed to injure the symbiote, Norrin gained enough control of himself and realize what is happening. When he knew that the Carnage symbiote will likely to control him again, he flew towards the sun, destroying them both.<\/p><h3>Earth-982<\/h3><p>In the MC2 universe, <a href=\"\/spider-girl\/4005-3365\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3365\">Spider-Girl<\/a> accidentally released the Carnage symbiote from its containment being care by <a href=\"\/shield\/4060-3775\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD<\/a>. It bonded to May's friend Moose Mansfield. Carnage later kidnapped May's father and baby brother, Peter and <a href=\"\/benjy-parker\/4005-46523\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46523\">Benjy<\/a>, respectively, who was later become possessed by the symbiote and became a little version of Carnage. Spider-Girl manage to kill the symbiote by using a sonic weapon of <a href=\"\/reverb\/4005-25523\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25523\">Reverb<\/a>, but also caused his little brother to become deaf.

A man named <a href=\"\/bolivar-trask\/4005-15923\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15923\">Trask<\/a> is trying to control the Venom symbiote and at some point he realizes that Peter's blood has bonds with the Venom serum (since his father used his own DNA to make the serum). Trask sets the suit free in hopes of it capturing Spider-Man. When they find Venom and Spider-Man they capture them by sending <a href=\"\/silver-sable\/4005-7608\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7608\">Silver Sable<\/a> after them, who shoots them both with strong tranquilizer darts. When Peter wakes up he is strapped to a table and a man named <a href=\"\/vulture\/4005-4459\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4459\">Tooms<\/a> is talking to him. He explains that the serum is part of Peter and that they are going to speed up the growth process by injecting more of the serum into Peter's blood. When the serum gets injected into Peter he screams in pain then suddenly bursts free from the table, becoming Carnage! Playing as Venom you must battle it out with Carnage. After a long fought battle Carnage is cornered in a room where the <a href=\"\/rhino\/4005-2126\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">R.H.I.N.O<\/a> suit was being designed. Venom and Carnage continue to fight while maintaining life by feeding on the various guards in the room. Venom finally beats Carnage and immediately feeds on him, stripping Peter of the Venom particles in his system and giving Eddie control of the Venom suit.<\/p><h4>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2<\/h4><p>Carnage was a playable character via downloadable content on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Carnage has many neat attacks in the game: he can throw axes, enlarge his head, and send tendrils out to attack enemies. You rank up for killing enemies. Carnage also had a rather animalistic semi-quadropedal movement style. As of December 31, 2010, Carnage will no longer be available for download because Activision allowed its rights to Marvel's intellectual properties to lapse. He was voiced by Fred Tatasciore.<\/p><h4><b>Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions <\/b><\/h4><p>Ultimate Carnage is the final boss for the Ultimate universe. The level opens with Ultimate Spider-Man reaching out to SHIELD to see if they can help locate the last fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos. Instead, he discovers that Carnage has just escaped from the SHIELD prison and is using the fragment to turn SHIELD agents into symbiotic zombies. Spider-Man must pursue Carnage through the facility, fighting off Carnage's minions and the few SHIELD units that remain. During the initial fight with Carnage, it is revealed that the symbiote is vulnerable to fire. After dodging a crashing SHIELD helicarrier, Spider-Man must climb to the top of a tower for the final showdown against Carnage, where SHIELD units help by providing fire support.

He was born in a moment of violence between Eddie Brock and Cletus Kasady due to Venom's action from the serial killer provoking him by bringing up old wounds, where he accidentally bit off a piece of the symbiote, which he recognized as something other than blood. During his execution, he began to fully emerge overtaking him from inside and then coming out as one entity and began rampaging through the prison to get the warden. Although he inherited his progenitor's weakness to sound, he would prove to surpass Venom in strength as he cut down through people in a more swift and violent way as he could also be fast enough to momentarily fly and sync with technology. He later helped kill someone for his clothes for Kasady while making a pact with him to kill his progenitor Venom while helping Cletus find Shriek, his lover, rampaging through the city in their pursuit of their goals.<\/p><h3>Broadway<\/h3><h4>Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark<\/h4><p>Carnage appears in the 2011 musical as a member of Green Goblin's Sinister Six.

The Jackal, in his deranged grief over Gwen Stacy's death, pitted Ben against the real Spider-Man in Shea Stadium, putting both in identical costumes and allowing both to believe they were the true Peter Parker. After a heated fight, the two Spider-Men teamed up to try to save a clone of Gwen from the Jackal. In doing so, Ben seemingly died. Spider-Man dropped Ben's body into a smokestack, unable to think of any other way to deal with a dead body identical to Peter Parker.<\/p><p>However, the clone was not dead and literally rose from the ashes. Believing he was the real deal, he went home only to find Peter already there. The world as he understood it fell apart, and he left New York. In time, he adopted the name of Ben Reilly, a combination of Uncle Ben's name and Aunt May's maiden name.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/1120747-ben_reilly_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120747\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2319749216301\" data-width=\"319\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 319px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/1120747-ben_reilly_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120747\"><img alt=\"The Spider Clone\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/1120747-ben_reilly_01.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/1120747-ben_reilly_01.jpg 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px\" data-width=\"319\"><\/a><figcaption>The Spider Clone<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The clone of Spider-Man who would go on to become Ben Reilly was created by Gerry Conway and Ross Andru and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man issue 149 (1975).<\/p><p>The full creation of Ben Reilly's character would not happen until years later in 1993 when Terry Kavanagh proposed having the clone return. Marvel Comics desired something dramatic for the Spider-Man franchise similar to the Death of Superman event DC Comics had. As such, the original proposal was to have this clone revealed to be the original Peter Parker. The proposal was met with skepticism at first, but soon, J.M. DeMatteis and Howard Mackie got behind the idea as well and finally so did Tom Defalco after some convincing by Danny Fingeroth. Soon, the collective Spider-Man writers and editors fashioned the clone into the character of Ben Reilly. Ben first appeared as the Scarlet Spider in Web of Spider-Man issue 118 (1994).<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><h3>Return of the Supposed Clone<\/h3><p>At the time of Ben Reilly's debut, Spider-Man had become a darker character who was losing touch with his life as Peter Parker. Ben was quite the opposite, having spent years away from the costume. In this way, he was more Peter Parker than Spider-Man was at the time. He was a purer version of Peter Parker that had not been burdened by the events that had recently dragged Spider-Man into brooding darkness, but his time away from costumed super-heroics had also left him rusty and less experienced.<\/p><p>It was the plan at this time for Ben to soon be revealed as the true Peter Parker rather than the clone and take over the Spider-Man identity for a time with Peter eventually being restored to it after seeing how Ben fared with readers. Originally, this entire three act story for Ben was intended to run its course by the 400th issue of <i>Amazing Spider-Man<\/i>.

The popularity of this identity got to the point where, even when it was time for Ben to become Spider-Man after many delays, his debut as Spider-Man was delayed even further to produce a couple months worth of issues of renamed titles such as <i>Amazing Scarlet Spider<\/i>, <i>Spectacular Scarlet Spider<\/i> and <i>Web of Scarlet Spider<\/i>.<\/p><h3>Spider-Man<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120837\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.86717557251908\" data-width=\"655\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 655px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120837\"><img alt=\"Ben Reilly as Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png 655w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ben Reilly as Spider-Man\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png 655w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/36207\/1120837-sm58.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ben Reilly as Spider-Man<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After being delayed a great deal longer than originally intended, Ben finally became Spider-Man with a redesigned costume.

He named himself Ben Reilly (Ben after his uncle's first name, and Reilly after his aunt's maiden name) and left New York deeply depressed. Ben was hit by influenza and met Seward Trainer (who was being blackmailed by the Green Goblin to keep on eye on him). Trainer helped Ben back up on his feet and find a job, all while Kaine was hunting Ben, believing Ben to be the real Peter Parker and hated his \"brother\" for it.<\/p><p>Three years passed and Reilly had been working in Salt Lake City as a research and teaching assistant, thanks largely to Trainer's references. Reilly met Janine Godbe who at first did not want to be involved with Reilly, but later revealed that her name is actually Elizabeth Tyne. Tyne also took ownership to being a child abuse victim, killing her abusive father, changing her name and running away to escape her crime. Despite her grisly and tragic past, Reilly accepted her and even trusted her enough to eventually reveal to her that he was actually a clone of Spider-Man. Tyne, in return, accepted Reilly for all of his intricacies.<\/p><p>When Kaine killed a corrupt policewoman named Louise Kennedy, the Police believed that Reilly was the murderer because both clones have identical fingerprints. Reilly and Tyne were on the run together for a year until Kaine forced her to leave Reilly, dropping a dead clone of her off a bridge to make Reilly think she had died.<\/p><h3>The Exile Returns<\/h3><p><b>For further details:<\/b> Clone Saga<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3133\/104188-102043-scarlet-spider.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-104188\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.765\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3133\/104188-102043-scarlet-spider.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-104188\"><img alt=\"Just Like Brothers\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3133\/104188-102043-scarlet-spider.JPG\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/3133\/104188-102043-scarlet-spider.JPG 400w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3133\/104188-102043-scarlet-spider.JPG 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Just Like Brothers\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3133\/104188-102043-scarlet-spider.JPG\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/3133\/104188-102043-scarlet-spider.JPG 400w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3133\/104188-102043-scarlet-spider.JPG 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Just Like Brothers<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Two years later, Ben Reilly returned to New York after receiving news that Aunt May had a stroke and was currently ill. While trying to visit Aunt May, he ran into Peter Parker, who was not happy to see that his clone was still alive. The two exchanged blows with Spider-Man too enraged to listen to reason, but Ben was able to knock him out and end the fight before it got too out of hand. Spider-Man was then lured into a trap at Ravencroft by Judas Traveller, and Ben felt compelled to help. Ben convinced Spider-Man that they were on the same side and managed to restrain Spider-Man's increasingly violent impulses as they fought their way through the psychotics of Ravencroft and out of Traveller's sadistic scenario.<\/p><p>Ben had no intent of staying in New York, but he also did not intend to leave until knowing whether Aunt May would recover. Seeing how far Spider-Man had fallen troubled him, and being back in New York made it increasingly difficult for him to stay on the sidelines. The final straw was the return of Venom. Ben could not accept the idea that Spider-Man had some kind of truce that allowed Venom to run free, so he threw together a costume to protect Peter's identity. His first confrontation with Venom went bad, leaving him with a serious gut wound. It also got out of control when Scream arrived and Venom began trying to kill her as well. Ben got a second wind and succeeded in defeating one of Spider-Man's most dangerous villains, using a new type of webbing he had developed to separate Eddie Brock from the symbiote. The symbiote, finding Ben very familiar, tried to bond with him only for Ben to reject it by sheer force of will. He made sure both Eddie and the symbiote were taken in by authorities.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/70801\/2421774-205499_208189919200101_143920528960374_786706_181978_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/70801\/2421774-205499_208189919200101_143920528960374_786706_181978_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/70801\/2421774-205499_208189919200101_143920528960374_786706_181978_n.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/70801\/2421774-205499_208189919200101_143920528960374_786706_181978_n.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Venom was just the beginning. Ben continued putting on his makeshift costume and fighting crime. Quickly, he was dubbed the Scarlet Spider by Daily Bugle reporter Ken Ellis. He hated the name, but it unfortunately stuck. He reached out to Betty Brant to set the record straight on the media's interpretation of him and found himself quickly swept up in romantic feelings for Spider-Man's past love interest. Meanwhile, Ben did not realize what all the media attention regarding the Scarlet Spider had done. The Grim Hunter, son of Kraven, began hunting him under the belief that he was simply Spider-Man in disguise. Also, Kaine realize Ben was the Scarlet Spider and came to New York. Ben was caught between two killers, trying to keep alive while trying to keep them from killing each other as well. He thought he defeated the Grim Hunter and that Kaine escaped. However, the Grim Hunter would pursue Kaine after Ben left and be killed by Ben's nemesis.<\/p><p>Surprisingly, Ben's return was followed by that of the Jackal's. Cloned and generically modified, the Jackal was now a physical threat to both Ben and Peter, but the real threat was what the Jackal had to say. He attempted to confuse the issue of who was the clone and who was the original. While Peter began to question things, Ben refused to play along as he had long ago accepted that he was just a clone regardless of what the Jackal now tried to imply.<\/p><h3>Mark of Kaine<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17809\/348878-62134-scarlet-spider.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17809\/348878-62134-scarlet-spider.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17809\/348878-62134-scarlet-spider.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17809\/348878-62134-scarlet-spider.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Ben's violent past with Kaine came back to haunt not him but Peter. Detective Jacob Raven had been investigating the murder of Louise Kennedy all these years and the trail led him to Peter. There was little that Ben could do as Peter was charged and put in jail. The situation got worse as the Jackal released another clone of Peter Parker. This clone was unstable and a danger to Mary Jane, forcing Ben to almost side with Kaine and a fugitive Peter to save her. When she was safe, Ben chose to take Peter's place in jail so that if the worst happened Peter could disappear with Mary Jane and still have a life.<\/p><p>Fortunately for Ben, Peter was able to get Kaine to confess to the murder and Ben was released. He and Peter then went to see Seward Trainer about the state of Mary Jane's pregnancy, and Trainer had some upsetting news. The pregnancy was fine, but he claimed there was signs that one of the parents was a clone. Ben and Peter used Trainer's lab to figure out the truth themselves, and both came to the same conclusion. Peter was the clone. Ben was the original.<\/p><h3>Maximum Clonage<\/h3><p>With Peter going off the deep end, it was up to Ben to stop the Jackal's insane plan to detonate a genetic bomb in New York. He was on his last leg when he found an unlikely ally in Kaine, who hated the Jackal more than Ben at the moment.<\/p><p>Eventually, Peter returned to his senses and helped Ben reach the bomb in time. Together, they were able to defuse it. and Ben risked his life disposing of the explosive contents in the river.<\/p><h3>New Warrior<\/h3><p>Hunting down Helix, a project of the Jackal's that got loose, Ben teamed up with the New Warriors and ended up being invited onto the team by Firestar. His time on the team proved to be very short, but in that brief time, he and Justice did not forge a very good relationship. Justice was new to leading the team and was not comfortable with the change in dynamic Ben brought. Ben also was not willing to reveal his identity to anyone, because he had the responsibility of protecting Peter's identity as well as his own. What also did not help was a slight attraction that developed between Ben and Firestar, Justice's girlfriend at the time.<\/p><h3>The Greatest Responsibility<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/760372-sm04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-760372\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.86071428571429\" data-width=\"280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/760372-sm04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-760372\"><img alt=\"The New Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/760372-sm04.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/760372-sm04.jpg 280w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The New Spider-Man\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/760372-sm04.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/36207\/760372-sm04.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The New Spider-Man<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After Peter and Ben risked their lives fighting the new Doctor Octopus, Peter realized he could not be a father and Spider-Man at the same time, so he proudly gave the mantle to Ben. At this time, Ben was still believed to be the original Peter Parker, so it was only fitting that he become Spider-Man again. He designed a new Spider-Man costume to mark the occasion rather than use the same as Peter's. Settling down in New York as Spider-Man also meant he had to finally build a life for himself.<\/p><p>He dyed his hair blonde to distinguish himself from Peter and was lucky enough to find a job at the Daily Grind, a coffee shop.<\/p><p>Skepticism followed his debut as many people were uncertain what to make of him and whether he was the same Spider-Man or someone new. Due to what a complicated story the truth was, Ben chose not to be very open about explaining it.<\/p><p>Ben quickly found himself fighting new and old villains alike. Mysterio returned with an all new look and improvements to his illusion technology. A new criminal called Armada hit the scene with an array of advanced gadgets. Ben found himself in something called the Great Game, where superhuman criminals competed in dangerous battles for points.<\/p><h3>Web of Carnage<\/h3><p><b>For further details:<\/b> Web of Carnage<\/p><p>The Carnage symbiote escaped from Ravencroft in search of a stronger host. It eventually found and merged with Ben Reilly to become Spider-Carnage and he was forced to try to kill Peter Parker and other innocent people. With the help of Dr. Ashley Kafka and John Jameson, the Carnage symbiote was successfully removed from Reilly.<\/p><p>Ben later became involved with a girl named Jessica Carradine, who was the daughter of the burglar that killed Uncle Ben. When she discovered that Ben was Spider-Man, it became a problem because Jessica believed that Uncle Ben was the one with the gun (who accidentally shot himself in the stomach) and that Spider-Man had killed her father to keep the truth from surfacing. Jessica went so far as almost mailing a picture of Ben in the Spider-Man costume to the Daily Bugle, but she had a change of heart when she saw Spider-Man save many innocent lives.<\/p><h3>Death of a hero<\/h3><p>It soon became clear that Ben's life was involved in a conspiracy when a skeleton of a Spider-Man clone was found in the same smokestack that he had once occupied, Seward Trainer disappeared, and Ben had his bank account frozen and his apartment's possessions stolen before finally the Grind (the place where he worked) was burnt down and Ben framed for arson. The Hobgoblin revealed that he was the man behind the clone conspiracy but it was later that in yet another twist the original Green Goblin, Norman Osborn, revealed that he was the true master mind. In a final definitive turn of events, the conspiracy was finally settled as Ben sacrificed himself to protect Peter from the Green Goblin\u2019s glider.<\/p><p>The glider cut deep into Ben's chest eventually killing him. Right before he died, however Ben told Peter that, clone or not, Peter is now Spider-Man and would have to carry on for Ben. When Ben died, though, his body decomposed rapidly, proving Seward Trainer's hypothesis. Peter, now aware that he always was the true Spider-Man, sends off his friend with this last touching remark: \"rest easy... brother.\"<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Clone Conspiracy<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8049427\" data-ratio=\"0.71851851851852\" data-width=\"1080\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1080px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8049427\"><img alt=\"Ben as the new Jackal\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.png 1080w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ben as the new Jackal\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.png 1080w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8049427-jackal_and_his_henchmen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ben as the new Jackal<\/figcaption><\/figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Ben was resurrected by The Jackal using a new procedure that retains memory through genetic material.

He sought out powerful casino owner, Cassandra Mercury. Her daughter, Abigail, had been a patient of New U, and Ben wanted to redeem himself by curing her. In addition to researching Abigail\u2019s condition, Ben would often hench for Cassandra, who also worked as a local mob boss. However, Kaine didn\u2019t believe Ben was dead. He tracked Ben to Vegas and confronted him. He let Ben live, though, for the sake of Abigail.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">When Abigail succumbed to her illness, Kaine tried to kill Ben, but Ben was defended by Death. She took a particular interest in Ben for dying and returning to life so many times. Death warned Ben that his many comings and goings from life have slowly corrupted his soul. It could heal, but one more trip would result in full corruption. However, when Death offered him the chance to resurrect Abigail or resurrect Kaine, he offered himself for both. Amused, Death brought both back without taking Ben\u2019s life and even fixed his carrion scars. However, if he ever compromised his morality again, his scars would slowly come back.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sometime later, Ben would cross paths with the angel, Gabriel. Gabriel gave Ben a vial of his own blood to cure Abigail with, but a demon warned Ben that it could damn Abigail to an immortal life. Ben hesitated to cure Abigail, which the demon took advantage of. He poisoned Cassandra and Kaine\u2019s minds, turning them against Ben by convincing them he was withholding the cure for his own profit. Ben would ultimately inject the cure, but because Abigail already passed, it didn\u2019t seem to work. Kaine and Cassandra continued to try to kill Ben. When he realized he couldn\u2019t dodge their attacks without them killing each other in the crossfire, Ben accepted his fate.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the other side, he met Abigail, who was ascending to her new cosmic status quo thanks to Gabriel\u2019s cure. She offered to send Ben back to life. Ben refused, remembering Death\u2019s words that he would become fully corrupt, but Abigail did it anyway. Ben, now even more sociopathic, attacked Kaine and told him if he survives his wounds to leave Vegas. After which, Ben would break down in an alley.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Spider-Geddon<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8049429\" data-ratio=\"1.545\" data-width=\"1600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8049429\"><img alt=\"Ben in Doc Ock's clutches\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg 1242w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg 621w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg 414w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ben in Doc Ock's clutches\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg 1242w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg 621w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8049429-spider-geddon_vol_1_4_textless.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ben in Doc Ock's clutches<\/figcaption><\/figure><p dir=\"ltr\">When Doc Ock approached Kaine for help with the Inheritors return, Ben followed them and volunteered to help.

They believed he was easier to manipulate than the other Spider-Man candidates. They offered him a sizeable salary and got his ex-girlfriend, Janine, out of jail so they could have a second chance together. Peter wasn't too happy about sharing the identity, at first, but when the U-Foes caught a lucky break and gave Peter radiation poisoning, Ben got his blessing to be Spider-Man while Peter was on the mend.<\/p><p>After a few missions with Beyond, Ben started acting out. He was losing his temper and becoming impulsive, putting himself and civilians in further danger. While working through it with Dr. Kafka, she revealed that Ben had many of his memories erased by Beyond. However, she had been attempting to put them back. She believed they were essential to what made Ben a hero but also blamed their reintroduction for his sudden confusions and outbursts. Ben did not take this news very well. His attitude toward Beyond shifted, and he started looking for a way out.<\/p><p>Janine had learned that Beyond was responsible for the recent super villains. When they got out of hand, they would disavow knowledge of it and use Ben to clean up the mess. After a brief team-up with Peter, now back on his feet, Ben lashed out and targeted the executive offices of Beyond on his own, currently being protected by <a href=\"\/slingers\/4060-43529\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43529\">The Slingers<\/a>.

Peter did not trust the device, forcing Ben to lash out against him. While they fought, she flooded the Beyond offices with a psychoactive substance that would alter reality, thus scrubbing Earth-616 of Beyond's existence. During their fight, Ben would get caught in this substance. He was assumed dead by Peter, but Janine went looking for him in the ruins of the building finding him transformed into a new being, Chasm, named for the void that now exists in his memories.<\/p><h3>Dark Web<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8797231\" data-ratio=\"1.5369836695485\" data-width=\"1041\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1041px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8797231\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg 1041w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg 624w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg 1041w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg 624w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11170\/111705043\/8797231-kingchasm1.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Obsessed with reassembling his memories and soul, Ben raids old Beyond safehouses for the tech he needs to do those very things.

He sent them to Limbo to bait Spidey into going their himself, which was a trap to imprison him in his own hell.

However, Madelyne turned on Ben when Jean Grey telepathically shared the memories of raising Cable. This caused the tree to wither as stealing Jean's soul was the original reason for its creation.<\/p><p>Janine refused to stop though. She stole Madelyne's demon scythe and gave it to Ben, transforming him into the new goblin king, with increased size, wings, and control of the goblin army.

This Peter was not so dark and brooding as he had been in the mainstream continuity, and after a brief scuffle, Ben found Peter able to put aside the hostility and accept that he had returned. Ben soon adopted his Scarlet Spider identity but also dyed his hair blonde and settled into a normal life working at the Daily Grind coffee shop rather than waiting until he became Spider-Man to do so.<\/p><p>The Jackal's return confused the issue of who was and was not the cloning, pointing the finger at Ben as the original. Both Ben and Peter decided it did not matter, because they had already accepted their lives. They were also successful in acquiring a treatment from the Jackal's lab that saved Aunt May's life, and Ben was finally able to talk to her face to face. Since Peter was about to become a father, he chose to step down as Spider-Man and give the costume to Ben.<\/p><p>Ben donned the Spider-Man costume of his own design, and quickly, the true architect of the clone conspiracy made himself known. It was Harry Osborn and not his father Norman. Ben was tortured and nearly killed, but it was surprisingly a clone of Norman Osborn who saved the day. In the end, it was made clear that Ben was the clone after all. Ben decided to give the Spider-Man identity back to Peter and leave New York, promising that he would return to visit from time to time. However, he had to go find his own place in the world now as the Scarlet Spider.<\/p><h3>MC-2 Universe (Earth-982)<\/h3><p>This alternate future of the Marvel Universe basically continued from where the Clone Saga ended, leaving Ben Reilly still dead at the hands of Norman Osborn and following up on the birth of Peter<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/138313-15552-darkdevil.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-138313\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4075\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/138313-15552-darkdevil.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-138313\"><img alt=\"Darkdevil, Son of Ben Reilly\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" data-width=\"454\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/138313-15552-darkdevil.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/138313-15552-darkdevil.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Darkdevil, Son of Ben Reilly\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/138313-15552-darkdevil.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/138313-15552-darkdevil.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" data-width=\"454\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Darkdevil, Son of Ben Reilly<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Parker's daughter. However, Ben's legacy would go on to be a strong one. May \"Mayday\" Parker, the daughter of Peter and Mary Jane Parker, became Spider-Girl and used the costume design Ben came up with as Spider-Man in her teenage years as Spider-Girl. Later, Felicity Hardy, the daughter of Felicia Hardy and Flash Thompson, adopted Ben's Scarlet Spider old name and costume for few brief stints as a superhero.<\/p><p>Ben's most notable legacy, however, was his son. Without Ben's knowledge, Elizabeth Tyne was pregnant when they parted those years before he returned to New York. Reilly Tyne suffered some ill effects from being the offspring of a clone, and it took supernatural intervention to ultimately save his life. This experience left Reilly with some supernatural abilities on top of the powers he inherited from Ben. He took up the identity of Darkdevil and became an ally of his cousin Spider-Girl.<\/p><h3>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610)<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650774\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650774\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Clone Saga\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg 426w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Clone Saga\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg 600w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/1650774-spider_man_woman34.jpg 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ultimate Clone Saga<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The name of Ben Reilly in the Ultimate Universe belonged to a lab assistant of Dr. Curt Connors and had no relation to Peter Parker, leaving Ben's actual counterpart in this universe difficult to narrow down.<\/p><p>This lab assistant stole a blood sample from Spider-Man and combined it with a sample of the Venom biomass, creating a horrific new life form he jokingly referred to as \"little Ben.\" This creature would become the Ultimate Universe's Carnage. However, Carnage would later become a clone of Gwen Stacy rather than Peter Parker.<\/p><p>Eventually, <i>Ultimate Spider-Man<\/i> told its own Clone Saga that had Dr. Octopus create a handful of Peter Parker clones using the blood sample from Dr. Connors' lab assistant. One of these clones was turned into a weapon by being crafted to cybernetic hardware, making him very similar to the Scorpion. Another was genetically modified, resulting in having six arms and fur, called Tarantula. However, only one of the clones went on to take on a new name and superhero identity separate from Peter Parker just like Ben Reilly did. This clone was modified to be female and took the name of Jessica Drew as Spider-Woman.<\/p><h3>Marvel Zombiverse (Earth-2149)<\/h3><p>In an alternate universe where a zombie plague swept over the entire Earth, Ben Reilly was among the superheroes infected and turned while he was still using the Scarlet Spider identity.<\/p><h3>Mutant X (Earth-1298)<\/h3><p>In this reality, the clone of Spider-Man was not called Ben Reilly but he shared the 6 armed mutation of the original and took Peter's identity when Peter retired. He was killed along with the Green Goblin by the Goblin Queen (Madelyne Pryor) when they became suspicious about her goal of world domination. The Brute (this reality's version of Beast) was charged for the murder and he pleaded guilty, and was therefore executed.<\/p><h3>Heralds (Earth-1122)<\/h3><p>In this reality, it was Ben Reilly who raised Peter's daughter, May Parker.<\/p><h3>What If Spider-Man's Clone Had Lived?<\/h3><p>During their original fight in Shea Stadium, it was the clone who made it through the explosion and the original Peter Parker who lost consciousness. The clone, believing himself to be the original, place Peter in cryogenic storage for the time being and left to resume what he believed was his life. It did not take him long to realize that strange gaps in his memory meant that he was truly the clone. There was nothing wrong with his memory, because there was no reason he should remember things Peter lived through between the time he was cloned and they met at Shea Stadium. Devastated, the clone still chose to free Peter from the cryogenic tank rather than steal Peter's life. He and Peter then decided that they would share the identity of Spider-Man and the clone would pose as his brother. Presumably, he never took the name Ben Reilly in this reality.<\/p><h3>What If the Scarlet Spider Had Killed Spider-Man?<\/h3><p>When the Jackal's programming forced Spider-Man to try to kill Mary Jane, Ben had no choice but to kill him as Peter begged him to. The resulting explosion also injured Ben badly, leaving him hospitalized and mistaken for the real Peter Parker. He could not bring himself to tell Mary Jane the truth right away, and the lie quickly took on a life of its own. He stepped into Peter's life as Mary Jane's husband and the father to their daughter May. May was sadly born with blood poisoning that could be treated but not cured, and Ben worked tirelessly to change that for years. Eventually, the Green Goblin returned to abduct May in order to use her blood to cure a mysterious condition of his own. Ben fought him, saving May and acquiring the goblin serum that could hold the key to curing her.<\/p><p>Witnessing the fight, Mary Jane realized who Ben really was, though part of her knew it all along. She was not angry but told Ben they could not continue as they were. She needed to accept Peter's death, and he needed to build a real life for himself as Ben Reilly.<\/p><h3>Life Story<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8295550\" data-ratio=\"1.589552238806\" data-width=\"670\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 670px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8295550\"><img alt=\"Ben saved by Peter\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" data-width=\"402\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg 670w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg 603w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg 402w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ben saved by Peter\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg 670w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg 603w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8295550-rco028_w_1555518549.jpg 402w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" data-width=\"402\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ben saved by Peter<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The clone of Peter during Life Story was created by Miles Warren under orders from Norman Osborn in the 1970s. Osborn intended to use the clone to replace Harry as his heir with a son Osborn could actually be proud of. Warren also created a clone of Norman (to use to pin Norman's crimes on) and Gwen (for Warren's own perverted reasons). Once Harry learned this, he tried destroying the clones. Peter was only able to save his own clone, but Warren admitted that he already switched Gwen with her clone, so the real Gwen was killed by Harry. With this new knowledge, Gwen took the new name Helen Parker and started a new life with Peter's clone, Ben.<\/p><p>In the meantime, Ben worked as a photojournalist and fashioned the identity of the Scarlet Spider. He wouldn't cross paths with Peter again until the 1990s. He was kidnapped by Doc Ock, so that Doc could study Pete and Ben and learn the secrets of Warren's cloning techniques. Doc Ock would reveal that Pete was the clone (a ruse from Osborn in Warren's notes), sending Ben into a rage over missing out on his life. After escaping from Doc, Pete gave his public life as CEO of Parker Industries and Spider-Man over to Ben, even though he had figured out Osborn's ruse. Pete was sick of the death in his life.<\/p><p>Over the next ten years, Ben stayed in contact with Pete well enough to be known as Uncle Ben to Pete's kids. Unfortunately, in 2006, he was killed by Morlun searching for the Spider-Totem.<\/p><h2>Other Media<\/h2><h3>Television<\/h3><h4>X-Men<\/h4><p><strong>For further details: X-Men: The Animated Series<\/strong><\/p><p>Scarlet Spider makes an appearance in the episode \"One Man's Worth\", where he is seen as a member of the Avengers in the Age of Apocalypse timeline.<\/p><h4>Fantastic Four: The Animated Series<\/h4><p><strong>For further details: Fantastic Four: The Animated Series<\/strong><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2678845-ben.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2678845\" data-ratio=\"0.72781065088757\" data-width=\"338\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 338px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2678845-ben.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2678845\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2678845-ben.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2678845-ben.png 338w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2678845-ben.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2678845-ben.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2678845-ben.png 338w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2678845-ben.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Scarlet Spider makes a brief cameo in the episode \"Nightmare in Green\", where he can be seen watching Human Torch and Rick Jones while clinging to the side of a building.<\/p><h3>Spider-Man: The Animated Series<\/h3><p><b>For further details:<\/b> <strong> Spider-Man: The Animated Series<\/strong><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2678844\" data-ratio=\"0.83235867446394\" data-width=\"513\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 513px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2678844\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png 513w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png 513w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/2678844-scarlet.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Ben Reilly, as the Scarlet Spider, appeared in the \"Spider Wars\" two part series finale storyline in the Spider-Man animated series of the 1990s. In this story, Ben comes from an alternate universe where the Jackal cloned Spider-Man and it has become unclear which is the original and which is the clone. Like in the comics he cuts his hair short and dyes it blonde. He dons a different costume identical to his comic book appearance. This pushed his world's Peter over the edge and when Ben confronted Kingpin, Peter attacked him. The two fought until a portal opened up and the Carnage symbiote latched onto Peter. This caused Peter to become the monstrous Spider-Carnage. Ben would confront Spider-Carnage with a team of Spider-men from other dimensions who were gathered by Madame Webb. Ben would not be the one to beat Spider-Carnage, but the Peter Parker of the shows main universe.

Although he has been revealed to be the half-brother of Kraven The Hunter, the face behind his trade-mark white mask \u2013 worn even beneath his other masks \u2013 has never been seen.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p>The Chameleon was born a Soviet citizen named <b>Dmitri Smerdyakov<\/b>. In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to <a href=\"\/kraven-the-hunter\/4005-2475\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven the Hunter<\/a>, Sergei Kravinoff, and eventually became a minor associate to one Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to Smerdyakov, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbours, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of the Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing on a spy gig, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on Spider-Man. Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues' gallery.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Chameleon was created by <a href=\"\/stan-lee\/4040-40467\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee<\/a> and artist Dan Ditko as the first member of Spider-man's gallery of rogues.

Kraven was no match for Spider-Man, and the two villains were arrested and deported back to Russia. They returned and the life-long feud between Spider-Man and Chameleon truly began.<\/p><p>Eventually these confrontations reached a more personal level. Using secret plans left by the late <a href=\"\/harry-osborn\/4005-2478\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\">Harry Osborn<\/a>, Chameleon discovered Spider-Man's secret identity. First he crafted androids of the hero's deceased parents. Believing them to be his true mother and father, Spider-Man was shocked when the androids were \"killed\" and revealed to be nothing more than machines. However, this was nothing compared to what followed.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2324704-specspider_man24521.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2324704\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.527724665392\" data-width=\"523\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 523px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2324704-specspider_man24521.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2324704\"><img alt=\"Knockout by MJ\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/79709\/2324704-specspider_man24521.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2324704-specspider_man24521.png 523w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/7\/79709\/2324704-specspider_man24521.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/79709\/2324704-specspider_man24521.png 418w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"><\/a><figcaption>Knockout by MJ<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After capturing Spider-Man, Smerdyakov disguised himself as his rival's alter-ego, Peter Parker, and attempted to rape his wife, Mary-Jane Watson. Although she was able to beat him off with a baseball bat, the experience deeply traumatized her.<\/p><p>Fortunately for Spider-Man's friends and family, Chameleon's memory is spotty at best. Years of abuse by his step-father and step-brother had taken its toll, and Chameleon was driven insane, unable to actually recall his actual identity due to the many years of pretending to be other people: he became a empty shell, one that he filled by his skills in impersonation. At one point, Chameleon donned the identity of the deceased Kraven after apparently assuming his personality and fully believing he was Kraven himself, even to the point that Kraven's own son was unable to tell if he was actually him or not.<\/p><p>Another time had Chameleon take a swan dive off of the Brooklyn Bridge, declaring his love for Spider-Man after using holograms to bait him out to see him. However, he survived this incident, as well as a near-fatal shooting by his nephew Alyosha Kravinoff, only to suffer the most embarrassing defeat of his career. Chameleon once again disguised himself as Peter Parker and tried to kill his Aunt May, but he was fed a drugged pie by the old lady and was once again captured.<\/p><p>Following the events of Brand New Day, all memory of Spider-Man's secret identity has been erased. Chameleon was seen impersonating newly elected president Barack Obama, until he was foiled by Spider-Man (who was photographing the event).<\/p><p>He also aided Sasha Kravinoff and the rest of Kraven's family in resurrecting him, even aiding in capturing Spider-Man by pretending to be a close ally of his. Of all of them he was the only one to realize Kraven probably did not want to be resurrected in the first place due to his his own madness and sense of honor. He was defeated with the rest of the Kravinoffs by a enraged Spider-Man.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2230141-2230140-screen_shot_2010_10_03_at_7.08.34_pm_300x370.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2230141\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.90819672131148\" data-width=\"305\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 305px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2230141-2230140-screen_shot_2010_10_03_at_7.08.34_pm_300x370.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2230141\"><img alt=\"He bought it\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-width=\"305\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2230141-2230140-screen_shot_2010_10_03_at_7.08.34_pm_300x370.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2230141-2230140-screen_shot_2010_10_03_at_7.08.34_pm_300x370.png 305w\"><noscript><img alt=\"He bought it\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2230141-2230140-screen_shot_2010_10_03_at_7.08.34_pm_300x370.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/7\/79709\/2230141-2230140-screen_shot_2010_10_03_at_7.08.34_pm_300x370.png 305w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-width=\"305\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>He bought it<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>He has most recently been seen as one of the villains participating in Doctor Octopus' \"scavenger hunt\".

In order to do this, he implemented a device in a belt buckle that emitted a gas that helped him mold his features, as well as storing extra masks and costumes for use. Later, the Chameleon obtained a microcomputer from <a href=\"\/spencer-smythe\/4005-17632\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17632\">Spencer Smythe<\/a> for his belt buckle that could be programmed with the facial features of hundreds of people (a prototype of this was a full costrume that did the same thing, but it proved to be too clunky in the field for actual success) The belt buckle also contains a video receiver that enables the computer to analyse the appearance of anyone the Chameleon encounters so that it can duplicate his\/her features using electrical impulses. The computer utilizes holographic technology that allowed him to change his appearance at the push of a button. His electronic devices allowed him to appear as two different people to two separate observers simultaneously. The Chameleon's costume consists of \"memory material\" that can be altered by electrical impulses from his belt so as to resemble the clothing of the person he is impersonating. This also allows him to blend in to the background of surfaces and hide, as well as create holograms close to him that mimic people almost perfectly.<\/p><p>Later, the Chameleon's powers are made innate: as a experimental serum rendered his flesh malleable, the pigmentation of his skin and even the nature of the epidermis have been surgically and mutagenically altered by a serum so that he can instantly take on the physical appearance of any person at will allowing him to look, imitate, and impersonate other various individuals. The Chameleon's malleable flesh can assume the appearance and features of virtually any human being he chooses. This includes changing his eye pigmentation, hair style or colour, body shape or type, and facial features. The Chameleon\u2019s abilities are limited only by the extent of his imagination. The Chameleon later required his Computer Belt in order to trigger this power. If he lost the belt, the Chameleon would revert back to his normal, dead-white form. However his true face wasn't known even to his family according to even Kraven himself, so this could actually have been his innate power all along. The Chameleon also wears fabric made of memory material that responds to nerve impulses and can appear to be what ever costume he wishes to be.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>When his past friendship with <a href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Sergei_Kravinoff_%28Earth-616%29\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sergei Kravinoff<\/a> was revealed, it was also revealed that the Chameleon had taken some of the same mystical serums that Kraven the Hunter had taken over the years. This would mean that the Chameleon\u2019s body is somewhat physically augmented. However it is at a much lower level than that of Kraven, as his augmentations may not have allowed him to reached superhuman level. This includes Enhanced Strength, Enhanced Endurance, Enhanced Durability, and Longevity slowing the Chameleon\u2019s natural aging process causing him to age at much slower rate than that of normal humans giving him a extended lifespan. Although it\u2019s unknown how long his life span is, seeing as how both the Chameleon and Kraven the Hunter are half brothers who grew up together, with Kraven remembering the Soviet revolution of 1917. This would suggest that the Chameleon is of a similar age making him to be over 70 years old, if not older, and yet have the physical appearance and vitality of someone in their 30ies, however with Marvel's Sliding Timescale, this might not be as drastic of a age difference as first expected.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Chameleon has had a limited education; however he was trained by the KGB.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Even without his powers or his Microcomputer Belt, the Chameleon is one of the world\u2019s greatest masters of disguise. The Chameleon is a master at creating lifelike masks and make-up. The Chameleon is also a quick-changing artist who can assume a new disguise in less than a minute, although he no longer needs to use such skills.<\/p><p>The Chameleon can also flawlessly imitate and mimic nearly anyone's voice and\/or speech patterns he hears, although he no longer needs to use such skills and is a brilliant <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Method_actor%20\/%20Method%20actor\" rel=\"nofollow \">method actor<\/a> and impressionist as well as being a master of both Politics and Business Administration when using his skills to get what he wants, as well as being a successful crime boss in the underworld (to the point that even <a href=\"\/kingpin\/4005-1483\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin<\/a> pointed out him as a feasible rival) The Chameleon can imitate others in such a convincing manner that, apart from the people closest to that person practically no one can tell the Chameleon and his victims apart. His natural talents are now increased by a serum that would allow him to alter his face at will.<\/p><p>The Chameleon can also speak fluently in several different languages including English, Russian, and others without using any kind of accent and is a formidable and experienced hand to hand combatant who possesses knowledge based on basic street-fighting techniques and was using any kind of fighting techniques and skills he learned from his time with the KGB, making the Chameleon an above average unarmed combatant. He's also surprisingly fast on his feet, able to leap around a rampaging <a href=\"\/hammerhead\/4005-6817\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6817\">Hammerhead<\/a> while wearing a fat suit.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Chameleon is a Master of Espionage, a skilled marksman and a explosive expert. The Chameleon is also a skilled pilot capable of driving and piloting helicopters and planes.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><b>Microcomputer <\/b><b>Belt<\/b><b>: <\/b>Later on, the Chameleon obtained a microcomputer belt buckle from Spencer Smythe. This microcomputer belt buckle serves three functions. 1. A video scanner receiver records and analyses a person\u2019s overall appearance including facial features of anyone the Chameleon encounters and feeds that information into a visual synthesizer that interpolates the rest of the person\u2019s appearance so that it can duplicate his or her facial features using electrical impulses. 2. Its memory banks can store up to hundreds of different images including facial features. 3. The computer utilizes Holographic Image technology that when an image is called up via a code tapped on the belt\u2019s keypad, subtle electrical signals trigger changes in the Chameleon\u2019s body and eye pigmentation allows him to change his appearance at the push of a button. A secondary signal alters the appearance of his clothing. His microcomputer belt buckle also is capable of allowed him to appear as two different people to two separate observers simultaneously by altering the perception of multiple viewers simultaneously.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><b>Memory Material<\/b><b>: <\/b>The Chameleon\u2019s clothing is made of a special fabric of memorial materials that can reshape and recolor itself by electrical impulses from his computer belt so as to resemble the clothing of the person he is impersonating. The change is triggered by his computer belt. Since the Chameleon can now take on the physical appearance of any person at will, the fabric made of memory material that now responds to his nerve impulses and can modified and appear to be what ever costume he wishes to be.<\/p><p><b>Knockout Darts<\/b><b>: <\/b>The Chameleon carries a small air pistol that fires darts up to 40 darts. These darts contain a potent anesthetic which knocks its victims out and makes them stay unconscious for several hours.<\/p><p><b>Knockout Gas<\/b><b>: <\/b>The Chameleon uses a small aerosol that can emit a cloud of potent, undetectable anesthetic gas that will knock its victim out where they will stay unconscious for several hours. This cloud is effective for over 10 feet (3.048 meters) away. The victims who fell asleep will stay unconscious for anywhere between 1 to 10 hours.<\/p><p><b>Smoke Bomb<\/b><b>: <\/b>The Chameleon uses a type of smoke bomb that will fill a 40 foot (12.192 meters) radius with an opaque mist.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Early In his career before the Chameleon gained his Computer Belt or his powers he used:<\/p><p><b>Masks<\/b><b>: <\/b>The Chameleon originally used masks that could be formed into a life-like copy of a chosen person\u2019s face. When the Chameleon\u2019s belt buckle emittes and sprays with a special gas, that helps it dissolved in order to mold his features and reverted to another shape, such as a different likeness or his normal white mask.helped him.<\/p><p><b>Colorshift <\/b><b>C<\/b><b>lothing<\/b><b>: <\/b>The Chameleon\u2019s original clothing was made of a special fabric that changed to another color when sprayed with a special gas.<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Alternate Version<\/h2><h4>Ultimate Chameleon (Earth-1610)<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1421434-cosmic_chameleon008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1421434\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5878378378378\" data-width=\"592\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 592px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1421434-cosmic_chameleon008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1421434\"><img alt=\"The Chameleon as Peter Parker\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" data-width=\"403\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1421434-cosmic_chameleon008.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1421434-cosmic_chameleon008.jpg 592w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1421434-cosmic_chameleon008.jpg 403w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Chameleon as Peter Parker\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1421434-cosmic_chameleon008.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1421434-cosmic_chameleon008.jpg 592w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1421434-cosmic_chameleon008.jpg 403w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" data-width=\"403\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Chameleon as Peter Parker<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In the Ultimate Universe, The Chameleon is an enigmatic energy-wielding shape-shifting thief slash <a href=\"\/mutant-growth-hormone\/4015-42280\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42280\">Mutant Growth Hormone<\/a> addict who, along with his sister Camellia, take whatever measures are necessary to get what they want.<\/p><p>When Peter went to <a href=\"\/ben-urich\/4005-4799\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4799\">Ben Urich<\/a> to show him the tape when <a href=\"\/kitty-pryde\/4005-3548\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde<\/a> was 'taken' away from Midtown High, when <a href=\"\/j-jonah-jameson\/4005-1487\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J.

It was shortly after this point that Petruski changed his name to the Trapster.<\/p><p>Retroactively, it was revealed that part of his motivation for the abrupt name change came from an encounter with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\">Spider-Man<\/a> who started laughing uncontrollably from the PPP alliteration when Petruski introduced himself. He hates his former name but he would never live it down. Heroes and villains alike remind him of the goofy name to make him furious.<\/p><p>The Frightful Four would nearly defeat the Fantastic Four on a few attempts, but they were thwarted by unlucky interference and chance encounters with the wrong people. However, there were two exceptions to this rule. First, the Frightful Four absolutely defeated the Fantastic Four in FF #38, \" Defeated by the Frightful Four\". After Medusa captured the Invisible Girl, Trapster pasted the blonde girl to make certain she could not escape. The Wizard then flew the four of them to an isolated Pacific island where a perfect trap had been prepared by the Wizard. They placed the unconscious Sue Storm in an underground chamber next to a Q-bomb, a powerful nuclear device. Then they waited for the rest of the Fantastic Four to arrive. When the FF came a battle ensued, but the Frightful Four managed to escape, leaving the FF on the island. The bomb exploded and while the FF survived, they totally lost their powers. The second win by the Frightful Four came in FF #41, when the Wizard captured the Thing and brainwashed him. With the Thing's might, the evil FF easily defeated their foes.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/108995\/2524915-daredevil_035___19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2524915\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.69\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/108995\/2524915-daredevil_035___19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2524915\"><img alt=\"Trapster defeats Susan Storm\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/108995\/2524915-daredevil_035___19.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/108995\/2524915-daredevil_035___19.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/a><figcaption>Trapster defeats Susan Storm<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>However, Trapster can boast of three very meaningful successes that he secured without the aid of his evil F.F. partners as follows: (1) His most amazing victory of all time came when he and his new team temporarily defeat and capture Annihilus in Fantastic Four #44, volume 3. (This follows a holographic Trapster victory over Annihilus in FF #40, volume 3.) Considering that Annihilus is one of the greatest foes that the Fantastic Four have ever faced, this is quite an achievement. (2) Trapster defeats the Invisible Girl all by himself and very nearly finishes her off. Disguised as Daredevil, he comes to the Baxter Building in Daredevil #35 and finds Sue Storm all alone. Before she can react, Trapster pastes the blonde girl helplessly to the floor. Then he brilliantly sets a powerful bomb go off, as soon as anyone might enter the room to try and save the doomed Invisible Girl, presumably the rest of Fantastic Four. Fortunately for Susan Storm, Daredevil hears someone leaving the building in Daredevil #36 and so he senses something is wrong. He is able to get rid of the bomb just in time to save the blonde girl's life. (3) Another superb solo victory by Trapster is in Fantastic Four #10, volume 3, when he defeats Mr. Fantastic but good! So much for the legendary leader of the Fantastic Four! Many foes have taken him on, one-on-one, but very few have beaten him. Trapster's victories over Annihilus, Sue Storm and Reed Richards, all without the help of his Frightful Four allies, should dispel the view of some comic fans that he is little more than a joke.<\/p><p>What Peter Petruski lacks in strength and combat skills, he makes up for in intelligence. He has also shown growth in his stature since the early days, as leadership is now one of his qualities, thanks to his being the leader of the team that took on and temporarily captured mighty Annihilus. It should also be noted that in FF #218, Trapster has two key victories. Even though is part of the Frightful Four in this issue, his battle wins come all by himself. Dressed up in a Spiderman costume, he first defeats the Human Torch and he then beats the mighty Thing!<\/p><h3>Making a Name for Himself<\/h3><p>For the sake of recognition Trapster tried to challenge lower level heroes on his own, but eventually blundered embarrassingly when he tried to take over the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\" href=\"\/baxter-building\/4020-41454\/\">Baxter Building<\/a> and was defeated by its robotic security.<\/p><p>Humiliated and frustrated by constant defeats, Trapster would seek out the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3144\" href=\"\/tinkerer\/4005-3144\/\">Tinkerer<\/a>'s aid in redesigning his arsenal.

He designed a costume of synthetic stretch fabric equipped with storage canisters for paste and lubricant, and adhesive-rigged boots and gloves to enable walking up walls. His primary weapon has always been projectile glue, initially delivered by a pistol connected by an armored tubing to a container on his person, then wrist paste-shooter cannons, and eventually shot straight from the tips of his gloves. He can shoot out a stream of liquid glue that immediately gels into a springy rope, allowing him to duplicate Spider-Man's web-shooters (to the point where he is the only person Spider-Man knows who can even create an approximate duplicate of his webbing). He was able to create a fire-proof paste. Pete also has designed boots that allow him to walk up walls by sequentially releasing a powerful glue and then a solvent. Petruski has also created lubricants that can render a surface frictionless, and discovered a way to dissolve the extremely powerful \"Adhesive X\" created by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3708\" href=\"\/baron-heinrich-zemo\/4005-3708\/\">Baron Heinrich Zemo<\/a>. Pete has also created a dust capable of rendering <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\" href=\"\/mr-fantastic\/4005-2151\/\">Mister Fantastic<\/a>'s unstable molecules inert. Trapster is an expert chemist, a skilled marksman, and a talented disguise artist. He has used other devices such as anti-gravity discs, explosive caps, ultrasound transmitters, an anti-gravity platform, and various mechanical traps used to restrain or entangle opponents.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-110796\/","id":110796,"name":"The Human Torch Meets Paste-Pot Pete!","issue_number":"104"},"gender":1,"id":4328,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/square_avatar\/11\/117763\/2363495-trapster.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/117763\/2363495-trapster.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/screen_medium\/11\/117763\/2363495-trapster.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/screen_kubrick\/11\/117763\/2363495-trapster.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117763\/2363495-trapster.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_large\/11\/117763\/2363495-trapster.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/11\/117763\/2363495-trapster.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/square_mini\/11\/117763\/2363495-trapster.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/2363495-trapster.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Earth-616 Trapster"},"name":"Trapster","origin":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-4\/","id":4,"name":"Human"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":"Peter Petruski","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/trapster\/4005-4328\/","resource_type":"character"},{"aliases":"Scarlet Spider\r\nAra\u00f1a Escarlata\r\nSpider-Man\r\nTarantula\r\nKaine Parker","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-8667\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":428,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:37","date_last_updated":"2023-04-06 10:14:10","deck":"Kaine was the first clone of Spider-Man created by the Jackal.

Kaine initially appeared to be perfect but a short while later his body began to break down. No longer a use to Warren, the scientist used him as a test body (in the process augmenting Kaine's already formidable powers) until he was finally discarded. A side effect of the treatment caused Kaine to become mentally unstable.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Kaine was created by Terry Kavanagh and Steven Butler and first appeared in Web of Spider-Man issue 119 (1994).<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>The Clone Saga<\/h3><p>After his first failure the Jackal created another clone and sent it against Spider-Man, but both were beaten and assumed dead. After the Jackal\u2019s defeat at the hands of Spider-Man, Norman Osborn (Green Goblin) switched Peter and Ben\u2019s files, making it look as if Peter was the clone. Kaine, who broke into the Jackal\u2019s lab and look those files, was led to believe the same thing, and followed Ben Reilly, aka the Scarlet Spider. Believing Ben was the real Peter Parker, he was determined to keep Ben away from New York so that his \"clone brother\" could live the life he was denied by the degeneration factor. While tracking Ben Reilly Kaine fell in love with a Salt Lake City police detective, Louise Kennedy, but Kaine discovered that she was corrupt and had lied to him. This fact, coupled with his genetic deterioration, drove him insane and he killed Louise. Determined to make Reilly suffer he stalked Ben where ever he went. He then made it appear that the girl Ben loved, Janine Godbe, had committed suicide.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-348878\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17809\/348878-62134-scarlet-spider.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5027932960894\" data-width=\"358\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 358px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17809\/348878-62134-scarlet-spider.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-348878\"><img alt=\"Ben's Worst Nightmare\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/17809\/348878-62134-scarlet-spider.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/1\/17809\/348878-62134-scarlet-spider.jpg 358w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/17809\/348878-62134-scarlet-spider.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Ben's Worst Nightmare<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When Ben returned to New York upon learning of May Parker's illness and took up super heroics Kaine read about his exploits. He left his \"Mark of Kaine\" on a mobster, a mark that contained Parker Prints, and made his way to New York, determined to keep Reilly from interfering in Peter's life. Upon his own return to New York Kaine began eliminating many of Peter's rogue's gallery. He killed Doctor Octopus, and the Grim Hunter in short order. He attempted to kill members of the Sinister Seven but failed due to the intervention of Peter Parker (dressed in Ben's Scarlet Spider costume). This was largely due to the fact Kaine was having precognitive flashes of Mary Jane Parker dying at the hands of some unknown assailant. Peter was eventually imprisoned for Kaine\u2019s murders (as they shared the same fingerprints) but Ben took his place. Peter attempted to make Kaine take responsibility for his crimes, which led to a fight. In the end, they both took part in a mock trial with Spider-Man on trial, Kaine as his defense attorney, Carnage as the prosecutor, several Ravencroft inmates as a jury, and Judas Traveller as the judge. Kaine attempted to fight off all those against Spider-Man, and Judas returned them to their previous battle.<\/p><p>Kaine fought with Stunner, who was avenging Dr. Octopus death, and after being severely weakened, he was knocked out by Spider-Man, who tied him up and brought him to the courthouse. Kaine woke before they arrived, and unveiled who he was and that he had done all this for Peter\u2019s sake. Peter threatened to reveal himself as Spider-Man to the courtroom and end everything unless Kaine confessed. Kaine gave in and told everything, including \u201cThe Mark of Kaine.\u201d<\/p><p>Peter, after learning that he was (supposedly) the clone, went to join the Jackal. Kaine refused to let Peter throw his life away and confronted the Jackal, prepared to kill him. The Jackal tricked Kaine into believing that he would be cured of his degeneration, and upon learning the truth, Kaine left, feeling dejected. He went to Mary Jane for answers, and after she taught him about responsibility, he left to help Ben as he fought many Spider-clones. In the ensuing battle, Spidercide impaled Kaine, killing him. Strangely, the Jackal put Kaine into a regeneration pod, and it was later found empty.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/4166910-431069_10151095352339349_41875862_n.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/4166910-431069_10151095352339349_41875862_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117763\/4166910-431069_10151095352339349_41875862_n.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p>When many of the strongest fighters were pitted against each other in The Great Games, a man named James Johnsmeyer found Kaine\u2019s pod and decided to enter him in the games. Kaine refused, and with the help of a temporary partner, Shannon, he escaped. Johnsmeyer sent Rhino, Joystick, and Polestar to force Kaine into the Games. Ben Reilly in his stint as Spider-Man intervened, and began fighting Polestar and Joystick as Kaine nearly killed the Rhino. Ben stopped him, and Kaine escaped with Shannon. Ben got a tracer on Shannon before they escaped. He found the two just before the police, and Kaine was escaped by threatening one of the officers. This time, Kaine and Shannon went to Johnsmeyer headquarters. Ben found them again, and Kaine destroyed all of Johnsmeyer\u2019s security equipment. Johnsmeyer revealed that Shannon had been working for him all along and had manipulated Kaine the entire time. Kaine attempted to kill Shannon, but Ben convinced him to spare Shannon. Kaine left, vowing that he would take down everyone who supported the games.<\/p><p>Later, Kaine encountered Ben and Janine Godbe who had recently returned to Ben. Kaine saved Ben after initially leaving him to die in a burning restaurant. Kaine finally acknowledging Ben as a brother, instead of an enemy. Kaine turned himself in to the police, and Janine (who was wanted for the murder of her abusive father) followed suit.<\/p><h3>Dark Reign<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1790032\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/80654\/1790032-kaine.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0470297029703\" data-width=\"808\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 808px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/80654\/1790032-kaine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1790032\"><img alt=\"Kaine Returns\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/80654\/1790032-kaine.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/80654\/1790032-kaine.jpg 808w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/80654\/1790032-kaine.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kaine Returns\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/80654\/1790032-kaine.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/80654\/1790032-kaine.jpg 808w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/80654\/1790032-kaine.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Kaine Returns<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>We are caught up on Kaine's status. His imperfect clone DNA is killing him and he is being hospitalized. Possibly due to the pain Kaine is \u201cvisited\u201d by Ben Reilly, the Jackal and other people from his past, the mirages he talks to help comfort and motivate him. These visions insinuate he is not imperfect and suffering from cellular deterioration but he is actually changing somehow and not dying as he thought. He is eventually awoken from some sort of lab table and is then escorted back to his cell in Hammer prison. While in his cell he thinks about his inevitable escape and he is only waiting for the perfect timing.<\/p><p>Kaine later escaped from prison to fight Norman Osborn, who he learned was alive and had been the mastermind behind the Clone Saga.

While Spider-Man followed a Spider tracer he had place on Damon Ryder aka Raptor, Spider-Man swings to a building that is under construction. Spider-Man is disappointed to find no sign of Ryder but he is shocked to see who is waiting for him in the shadows... Kaine.<\/p><p>Then we are caught up in the history between Damon Ryder and Ben Reilly we see Kaine lurking in the shadows a few times while Damon and Ben's friendship unravels and Damon begins changing due to the dinosaur DNA inside of him. Could Kaine possibly be to blame for the slaying of the Ryder family and the birth of Raptor?<\/p><p>In the present Spider-Man and Kaine begin fighting for no reason. Spider-Man comically questions Kaine's return and intentions which only makes Kaine angrier. Kaine reveals he needs Damon Ryder (and possibly Ben Reilly) to help stop his cellular deterioration. The battle does not quite end but is delayed when Kaine throws a taxi (filled with people) into the air which Spider-Man, of course, catches and saves but while Spider-Man saves the taxi Kaine sneaks away. An interesting thing was said during Kaine's and Spider-Man's in-fight banter; while mentioning Kaine's violent past he believe Peter has the same tendencies because he (Peter) is him (Kaine) but Peter rebuked by saying he has it backwards.<\/p><h3>The Grim Hunt<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1299530\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.86513157894737\" data-width=\"1216\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1216px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1299530\"><img alt=\"Tarantula\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg 1216w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tarantula\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg 1216w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5820\/1299530-tasm_637051.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Tarantula<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Later Kaine was hunted by Ana Kravinoff and Alyosha Kravinoff , they manage to hurt him quite severely, and he runs to Peter Parker's current apartment, with a warning: \"the spiders are being hunted\".

He then joins Peter's fight with the Kravinoffs, but when the Spiders are losing, Kaine pushes peter into an open grave and buries him, while he takes his outfit and reenters the fight as Spider-Man. He is then killed by Sasha and sacrificed to resurrect Kraven the Hunter. After the events of the Grim Hunt, Kraven and her daughter (after killing the family members) flew to the Savage Land.

Jackal kept his name of Tarantula. Given that he was in a spider-humanoid form, he was susceptible to manipulation and easily controlled by the Queen. He follows the orders until the Queen ordered Kaine to destroy the cure for Spider-Island. There he tussles with Spider-Man and when Peter regained his spider-sense, Kaine was tossed into the vat containing the cure. Upon Peter pulling him out of the vat, Kaine notices that he is cured of his monstrous spider look, his scars that had plagued him since cloning, and the Queen's hold over him is now also gone. As Max Modell and the rest of the scientists are about to come into the lab, Pete gives Kaine his Spider-Man costume to put on. After not being found out, Pete leads Kaine back to his private lab where Kaine ultimately calls dibs on the Stealth suit. Using Peter's stealth suit, Kaine joins the various other heroes in their final assault against the Queen. Knowing that Peter Parker would never deliver the needed blow, Kaine uses his spider stingers to kill the Queen. Shortly after the defeat of the Queen, Madame Web tells Kaine that his future was his own and that he needed to start finding his own path again.

He arrives in Charlotte, North Carolina in order to switch buses to Houston. He spends the last of his cash on the bus ride. Kaine dreams of a new life as he blends into the crowd while walking to the bus. As he thinks about the last time he laughed, an explosion goes off in the distance. There is a bank robbery in progress by men wearing masks of the many different Avengers. He notices a squad car tearing down the street. He wonders if they will be able to handle the situation or if people will get hurt instead. He decides to let them deal with it and gets on the bus. He tells himself that people die every minute of every day. He finds a seat on the bus and sets down his duffel bag. It is slightly open and a new spider costume rests inside it. He tells himself that he is a failed experiment, an imperfect clone, and that ever since his \"birth\" he has been dying. But now for the first time in his life, he isn't dying. He realizes that he has a second chance at life.Kaine can feel a voice gnawing at him. Peter Parker judging him. He decides all that he wants is life and to experience it. With that thought he swings out of the emergency exit of the bus toward the action. The cops have the bank's perimeter secured and are negotiating with the robbers inside who have hostages. Kaine sneaks in and takes out one of the men. The others spin around to shoot at him with their Uzis. As he fights them, he thinks of himself as the monster. Its all he's ever known. Pain, fear, violence that was his life. He begins to think that this time things can be different. He takes out everyone except for the leader. Kaine approaches him slowly. He knows that killing him would be the most natural thing to do, but what if things could be different? Cops burst into the room only to find the robbers webbed to the ceiling.<\/p><p>Kaine walks down the highway knowing that he was a monster and that he did bad things. He wonders, now that he's not dying if he could truly live. He stops to feel the rain on his face. Then, he continues on knowing that he isn't Peter Parker, but he just might have his luck.<\/p><h3>Life After Death<\/h3><p>Kaine has been in Houston for a few weeks when he overhears a man talking about some kind of deal involving a lot of money going down at the docks. Kaine follows the man to where the deal is going down and proceeds to beat all the men there. He picks up the bag of money and turns to leave. Before he can he catches a strange scent. Ripping open one of the containers he finds a lot of dead bodies and realizes that the men must have been dealing in human trafficking. Spying one girl still alive he rushes her to the Hospital where he is mistaken for the bad guy and quickly leaves before he hurts someone. Kaine then hitches a ride to downtown Houston where he used the money he stole to pay for the room and reminisces about his past. Deciding he needs a fresh start he shaves his beard and hair before going out web-swinging (without his costume).

She replies in Spanish which Kaine doesn't understand. At that moment The doctor he'd seen earlier enters with a police officer. At first Kaine thinks they might try and arrest him, quickly saying that he doesn't want any trouble but the doctor and the police officer both agree that Houston needs a hero and Kaine might be it. Kaine replies saying he is leaving and that he just wanted to make sure that the girl was ok. To which the doctor responds that medically she is fine but that she is in the country illegally and will most likely be deported and that over in Mexico they wouldn't be able to protect her from the people who sent Salamander. The police officer states that Kaine as a vigilante could do something about it. Kaine leaves, jumping out the window telling them to forget it. The doctor returns to check on the girl later that evening to find she is gone. It is revealed that Kaine has had a change of heart, taking her from the hospital and hiding her in his hotel room.<\/p><p>Having saved Aracely from the fire Kaine allows Doctor Meland to come to his hotel room to treat her. The Doctor then heads back to the hospital for supplies where a sniper attempts to kill him but is saved by the Scarlet Spider.

During their fight Kaine is forced to unmask and the assassin recognizes him before escaping. Upon returning to the Doctor, Kaine explains that now the Assassins would be coming for both of them as he has a past with the Guild. Kaine is able to stave off the assassins in a brutal fight.

He leaves very quickly the next morning when he realizes that the woman was actually the one responsible for the attack. After some deliberation, Kaine decides to look into the attack. With the help of Officer Layton, Kaine breaks into Roxxon and makes his way to the C.E.O of Roxxon David Walsh and confronts him on why he covered up the attack and the explosion of one of his oil rigs in Glaveston. Walsh informs Kaine that he covered up the attack as the woman who attacked the building was in fact his daughter and tells the Scarlet Spider to leave just as the Rangers show up.<\/p><p>Kaine fights off the Rangers and escapes taking Zoe with him. Although skeptical to believe anything she tells him, Kaine agrees to break into Roxxon so Zoe can show him the \"evil\" that is going on there. Tearing through Roxxon attracts the attention of the Rangers yet again. As they fight, the floor is destroyed to reveal an underground lab where Roxxon has been keep a creature called Mammon.<\/p><p>Kaine and the Rangers attempt to beat Mammon to no avail until the Scarlet Spider realizes what was keeping Mammon trapped in the first place was the oil.

Upon entering he finds many dead bodies all of which were killed by someone \"who enjoyed it\". The Scarlet Spider finds one man still alive who for some reason is visibly terrified of Kaine. At the hospital, Dr. Meland finds out that the man's name is Ryan Ketola and that he was attacked by a monster that looked like the Scarlet Spider, the same monster who killed the people in that building. He tells them that the creature was after his wife not him so Kaine sets out to find her before the monster does. The monster is later revealed to be Carnage. Kaine arrives just as Carnage is about to attack Dr. Ketola and the two have a brief fight in which Carnage escapes by teleporting himself and his accomplices away taking the doctor and a reporter with him leaving Kaine seething in anger just as Agent Venom, who has also been tracking Carnage, arrives on the scene.<\/p><p>After a brief confrontation with Venom due to Flash temporarily losing control over the symbiote (which was most likely due to Kaine's connection to Peter) it is revealed that Carnage has been teleported to the Micro-verse. Venom attempts to convince Kaine to help track Carnage down but he declines as Carnage should no longer be a problem now that he is in the Micro-verse. After reconsidering Flash's words however the Scarlet Spider returns and he and Venom both use the same teleporter Carnage took to enter the Micro-verse. When Kaine regains consciousness he finds that he has been separated from Venom during the journey and a mysterious man dressed in green is standing over him not mention a very angry giant scorpion-like creature about to attack. The Scarlet Spider defeats the creature and the stranger reveals his name to be the Redeemer he the proceeds to heal Kaine of his injuries. As they explore the Micro-verse the Redeemer reveals a bit more about who he is. That he opened himself to the Enigma force and that he plans to heal Marquis Radu to prevent more war in the Micro-verse. They are both taken by surprise by Carnage. Who proceeds to attack the Scarlet Spider.<\/p><p>Kaine and Carnage engage in another brutal fight which ends abruptly as Kaine is forced to save Redeemer from falling. He succeeds in saving Redeemer who then reveals that he is the embodiment of the Enigma force and that symbiotes are a \"cancer\" that is going to kill him. He also tells Kaine that if he dies the Enigma force dies with him taking both the Micro-verse and the Scarlet Spider's Universe with it. Kaine catches up with Venom and helps him fight off Carnage and an army of symbiotes created by Radu. They succeed and Carnage disappears. The Redeemer says that he can no longer sense him and it is revealed that Carnage is now back in the normal universe however due to being shrunk down when entering the Micro-verse he has come back tiny and has split into multiple copies of himself. The tiny army of Carnages start massacring people around Houston before reforming into a normal sized Carnage. The Redeemer manages to send Venom, Scarlet Spider and the reporter back to their own universe. However like Carnage they arrive back tiny and Kaine and Venom are force to fight a now giant looking Carnage until eventually the effect wares off and Venom and Scarlet Spider are able to fight Carnage in their normal bodies. After a long fight Venom manages to take out Carnage with a sonic grenade. Seeing Cletus for the monster he is Kaine uses his stinger to lobotomize Carnage much to Venom's horror. The Scarlet Spider then leaves, leaving Venom to get Carnage under lock and key.<\/p><h3>The Man In The Presidential Suite<\/h3><p>After the events of Minimum Carnage, Kaine takes the deaths of the people there quite personally, gets drunk, gets into an argument with Aracely, Meland and Layton before attempting to leave Houston but passes out from the alcohol. Meanwhile the Hotel he is staying at is being robbed by multiple gunmen. Aracely and Layton attempt to subdue some of them and Aracely demonstrates some form of telepathy in the process while Meland frantically attempts to revive Kaine with coffee. As he wakes up Kaine opens up to Meland about his past just as Annabelle with one of the robbers holding her at gunpoint enters the room. Now fully awake Kaine proceeds to beat down the gunmen. A little later a letter addressed to K. Parker from Julia Carpenter is seen arriving at the Hotel.<\/p><h3>The Mark<\/h3><p>After a young girl is found dead with a hand print burned into her face in much the same way Kaine used to mark his victims the Scarlet Spider sets his sights on local gangs to try and discover who killed her and who is trafficking people. His search leads him to the Hand and after a brief fight with the man copying his mark and Bruiser a man who says that he is a messenger from the Kingpin explains that Fisk plans to see to things in Houston personally and that he has no quarrel with Scarlet Spider as long as he stays out of his way. Bruiser then kills the man who marked the girl and leaves. Leaving a very confused Scarlet Spider trying to understand the situation. The Scarlet Spider is next seen at the girl's funeral vowing to use his powers to hunt down monsters like his old self. Meanwhile at the Texas\/Mexico border a pair of wolves approach a car but seem to transform into humans before reaching it. One of them asks the guards there to take them to Houston.<\/p><h3>In the Midst of Wolves<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2803085\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5174825174825\" data-width=\"572\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 572px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2803085\"><img alt=\"Kaine fighting against the werewolves\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg 572w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kaine fighting against the werewolves\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg 572w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/145699\/2803085-2646371_scarletspider_13_cover_super.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Kaine fighting against the werewolves<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Kaine continues his effort to eliminate human trafficking in Houston.Suddenly Aracely remembers something about her past in a dream.When Kaine and Aracely go out for a walk.She explains her past to Kaine and then suddenly they are confronted by the Werewolves Carlos Lobo and Esmerelda Lobo.Kaine and Aracely quickly flee from them.Suddenly Aracely starts howl just like the Bruiser.Kaine takes on the werewolves but was no match for them and they start devouring his flesh.<\/p><p>Kaine having been killed by the two werewolves reawakens in a church and encounters a priest who tells him to confess his sins. After the priest begins to shapeshift (becoming Ben Reilly, Louise Kennedy and the Jackal) Kaine realizes that something is wrong. After threatening him the priest reveals himself to be the \"Other\". The same entity that gave Peter Parker his extra powers in \"Spider-Man: The Other\" and the one who resurrected Kaine after his death in \"Grim Hunt\". The Scarlet Spider initially reacts violently to the creature saying that he if he's dead he wishes to stay dead. Just as he is about to kill the other he remembers Aracely is still being hunted by the wolves so agrees to let the \"Other\" bring him back with new abilities.<\/p><p>After his resurrection a now transformed Kaine hunts down Carlos and Esmeralda and brutally beats them before they can hurt Aracely ripping out Carlos's eye and tearing his arm off in the process. After Esmeralda takes her brother and flees Aracely attempts to approach Kaine to which he acts violently before regaining control of himself and changes back to normal. After the incident Kaine makes peace with the fact that he is a monster.

Aracely telepathically told Jean to tell Logan to play along. After recovering Wolverine gets his shots on Kaine who felt he deserved it. Kaine teams up with Logan and they invade the Assassin's Guild. Soon, Harvester, Smithy, Flower and eventually Bella Donna herself appears to try and kill the duo. Bella Donna states they must die to prevent Candra from being summoned. They resist, however, and the Red Death is summoned. Kaine manages to turn most of the Assassins' Guild against Candra to prevent her from taking over the guild; Bella Donna is the only one to refuse. Even so Wolverine and Kaine manage to defeat and kill Candra. And before Bella Donna attacks again, the Arranger enters and reveals that guild is now owned by Fisk. With this revelation, Wolverine and Kaine are free to go and they head back to the mansion to get Aracely.<\/p><h3>Sibling Rivalry<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3047807\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5177777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3047807\"><img alt=\"Scarlet Vs Superior\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg 900w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Scarlet Vs Superior\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg 900w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3047807-scarspider_20-cover.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Scarlet Vs Superior<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Kaine returns to new York to check on Spider-man (Currently Superior Spider-man) to make sure everything is ok having seen Peter's new found fondness for violence in the media.

Whilst swinging, he falls to the street below where he's confronted by the original Scarlet Spider, Ben Reilly. As Ben and Kaine fight, Ben states that he had faked his death and was living a quiet life until news of Kaine using his persona reached him and he was spurred to confront him. Ben tells Kaine that he can never be a hero or have a decent life due to the horrible things he's done, including capturing and torturing Ben in the past. The two battle on a rooftop with Kaine unmasking Ben, believing him to be an imposter. However this theory is disproved when Kaine finds Ben's face under the mask. Suddenly, The Jackal and Superior Spider-Man appear on the rooftop where the two Scarlet Spiders are fighting and urge Kaine to kill Ben. It's at this point Kaine realizes that he is hallucinating, having been poisoned earlier. Ben then states that Peter would have realized the deception sooner, stating that Kaine was struck by a blow-dart in the airport and not bitten by a mosquito as he had thought. The drugs caused his erratic behavior and led to him hallucinating the scars on his face.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3275172\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111113435\/3275172-screen%20shot%202013-08-28%20at%2023.02.40.png\" data-ratio=\"1.0968992248062\" data-width=\"516\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 516px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:109.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111113435\/3275172-screen%20shot%202013-08-28%20at%2023.02.40.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3275172\"><img alt=\"I have toyed with you enough little spider\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111113435\/3275172-screen%20shot%202013-08-28%20at%2023.02.40.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111113435\/3275172-screen%20shot%202013-08-28%20at%2023.02.40.png 516w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111113435\/3275172-screen%20shot%202013-08-28%20at%2023.02.40.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"I have toyed with you enough little spider\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111113435\/3275172-screen%20shot%202013-08-28%20at%2023.02.40.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111113435\/3275172-screen%20shot%202013-08-28%20at%2023.02.40.png 516w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111113435\/3275172-screen%20shot%202013-08-28%20at%2023.02.40.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>I have toyed with you enough little spider<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As the effects of the drug wear off, 'Ben' is revealed to be Kraven the Hunter, who tells Kaine that the two have \"unfinished business\".

He fights his way through the Zoo until he encounters Ana who engages him. During the fight she tells Kaine that they have killed Dr. Meland, Officer Wally, Aracely and Anabelle driving the Scarlet Spider into a blood-lusted state and viciously beats down Ana.

Using Ana to guide him to Kraven the two prepare to engage while Dr. Meland, Wally, Aracely and Anabelle watch helplessly. Refusing to fight at first, Kraven relentlessly bashes on Kaine, begging for him to kill him for a warrior's end. Still holding back, Kraven orders Ana to kill all of his friends.

There, Kaine informs them how serious the Carrion Virus is and how his had been activated.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8045452\" data-ratio=\"0.86908690869087\" data-width=\"1818\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1818px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8045452\"><img alt=\"Carrion Kaine\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg 1818w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Carrion Kaine\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg 1818w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg 960w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8045452-rco007_1483557539.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Carrion Kaine<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When Anna Marconi informs the wrong cop about Reilly, Reilly is tipped off and sends Electro and Rhino to attack Horizon Labs.

They determined that a frequency was causing the degradation, and they had chosen to test their theory on Kaine. For her good work, Reilly offered her to upload her genius brain into a better body.

He tracked him to Las Vegas and a New U patient, Abigail, a daughter of a wealthy casino owner, Cassandra Mercury. Kaine fights mercilessly while Ben tries to convince him that he honestly wants to help people, specifically Abigail. So, Kaine agrees to a temporary truce for the sake of Abigail.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the meantime, Kaine falls in with Terry and her veteran group when she mistook his Carrion scars for napalm burns. She was going to lose her shelter when her landlord decided to sell it. Kaine hoped Ben could get his new employer to help, but when he found out Cassandra was kidnapped, he pitched in to find her. For his help, Mercury gave him the money he needed to save the shelter.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Soon after, Terry\u2019s football player brother, Kerry, showed up for a visit. He said his teammates have been targeted by an unknown assailant, so Kaine put a spider-tracer on him in case he was attacked. It didn\u2019t take long before Hippo attacked. Luckily, Kaine was able to defend Kerry and get a name out of Hippo: Marlowe.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">His search for Marlowe barely got off the ground. Ben kept attracting supernatural weirdness, including Mysteria, Mysterio\u2019s magic using daughter, a Mindless One run rampant, and a shady deal Ben made with Mephisto. That deal backfires when Mephisto makes it look like Ben was withholding the cure from Abigail for profit, catching the ire of both Kaine and Cassandra.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ben fought them both the best he could without really hurting either of them, desperate to prove he was a better person. However, Kaine ultimately shot him dead. Ben didn\u2019t stay dead for too long though. He came back thanks to a future version of Abigail, but the trip from the other side corrupted his soul. He stabbed Kaine and told him if he survives to get out of Vegas.<\/p><h3>Spider-Geddon<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8046087\" data-ratio=\"1.528384279476\" data-width=\"916\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 916px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8046087\"><img alt=\"Spider-Force\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 916w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 628w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 418w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Force\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 916w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 628w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/124259\/8046087-spider-force_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 418w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider-Force<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>While using Inheritor cloning tech, Doc Ock opened the door for them to attack again. He started assembling Spider-Heroes from around the world, including Kaine. Otto needed a group of heroes to go to the radioactive planet the Inheritors escaped from to destroy a crystal with the data to revive the Inheritor\u2019s father, Solus. Kaine volunteers to lead this Spider-Force.<\/p><p>He recruits Jessica Drew (Earth 616), Ashley Barton (Earth 807128), and a teen version of Peter Parker calling himself Charlie (Earth 218). Their radioactive suits are only good for 15 minutes, so they have to make it quick. Once they get there, though, all the teleporter watches short-circuit. Kaine had sabotaged them so that Vera, the Inheritor they were tracking, couldn\u2019t use them to escape.<\/p><p>They immediately cross paths with a version of John Jameson, who turned into a telepathic Spider-Astronaut on this planet, protecting the last of mankind on a space station away from the radioactive planet. He receives an SOS from the station, convincing the team that Verna was looking for the crystal there. They all head up on John\u2019s ship and split up on the station. John finds her first and seemingly slays her with the crystal, giving Jess the chance to steal her teleporter watch. Verna wasn\u2019t dead though. She regains consciousness and feeds on John.<\/p><p>With the crystal but no watch, Verna is stuck in this reality, so Kaine and the others retreat to the planet to set a trap. They still need to destroy the crystal before they leave. Guilty over the danger he put everyone in, he instructed his team to use the last working watch and go home. Verna attacks before they could though. In the struggle, the watch is activated, sending Jess with the crystal back to Earth-616, stranding Kaine and the others on the radioactive planet.<\/p><p>Kaine and the others are later saved by Spider-Gwen, who traveled Earth to Earth putting together a Spider Army for the final showdown with the Inheritors.<\/p><h3>End of the Spider-Verse<\/h3><p>When <a href=\"\/shathra\/4005-41756\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41756\">Shathra<\/a> led her <a href=\"\/sisterhood-of-the-wasps\/4060-53126\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-53126\">Sisterhood of the Wasps<\/a> to reform the Great Web into her Great Nest, she started to turn a number of Spider-Heroes into her wasp drones.

His Strength far exceeds Spider-Man's own. Kaine could fight the Scarlet Spider, Spidercide and Spider-Man to a standstill, even with the three each being capable of lifting an excess of 10 tons. He was seen effortlessly One-Shotting and killing multiple Spider Clones, each with physical abilites comparable to Spider-Man, as well as effortlessly beating down Rhino. Kaine's Durability is also superior to Spider-Man's, as he was able to tank a massive explosion without any form of discomfort. He also tanked a full power blow from Spider-Man, without so much as flinching, as well as a bullet to the shoulder which barely slowed him down. Kaine's version of \"spider-sense\" is so acute and powerful enough that it gives him a slight glimpses into the future, it is a sort of precognitive ability. An ability only Kaine posses is \"the mark of Kaine\" this is his corrosive touch that he uses to scar and even kill people with. He also has short retractable claws, which he call the \"Sting of Kaine\". Along with the powers of Peter Parker aka Spider-Man he has many of his memories and his genius intellect like his vast knowledge of the sciences. Kane's excessive strength and Durability, along with Mark of Kaine made him fight in a completely different way then his spider peers, despite his enhanced speed and agility (he was fast enough to speed-blitz Spider-Man) . The true reaches of his regeneration, have not yet been explored since after Sasha pierced his heart he was still later able to rise from the grave with a new look, it as not yet been explained if it was something mystical or if it was his actual healing factor.<\/p><h3>Scarlet Spider:<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3243044\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5177777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3243044\"><img alt=\"Scarlet Spider\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg 900w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Scarlet Spider\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg 900w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg 632w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3243044-scarspsider2012024.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Scarlet Spider<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After being cured of his Tarantula form his powers changed and now resemble Spider-man's power-set after the events of The Other, but before Brand New Day.<\/p><p><strong>Superhuman Strength-<\/strong> Thanks to the Other Kaine is physically stronger than Spider-man and is able to lift 20tons without exertion.

He even ripped off the arm of Carlos without issue, despite the latter having high levels of Superhuman durability.<\/p><p>In his fight with Shantra, his ascended form easily beat her, despite being overpowered by her in his normal form.<\/p><p><strong>Organic Webbing-<\/strong> Like his \"regular form\", Ascended Kaine had the ability to produce Organic webbing, but he seemed able to produce is much larger volumes, and quickly incapacitated Esmeralda Lobo with it.<\/p><p><strong>Claws-<\/strong> As well as his stingers, Ascended Kaine has sharp claws on each finger, which he used to rip out one of Carlos' eyes.<\/p><p><strong>Fangs-<\/strong> Ascended Kaine has sharp Fangs, which were easily able to penetrate Carlos' flesh.<\/p><p><strong>Spider-Limbs-<\/strong> Along with his usual limbs, Ascended Kaine, has four Spider-Like limbs sprouting from his back. Similar to Iron Spider's Limbs, these retractable appendages were strong enough to impale the Werewolves without much issue.<\/p><p><strong>Shape-shifting-<\/strong> Kaine was first able to transform back into his original form, after help from Aracely. He later Shape-Shifted back to his normal form by himself after beating Shantra.<\/p><p><strong>Healing-<\/strong> When Kaine was transformed out of his Feral form, all his injuries sustained by the Werewolves were gone, as well as his tattoo. This form of extensive healing is beyond Kaine's normal limits and probably likely to be a one time thing, similar to Spider-Man undergoing extensive healing after reverting to a Human-Spider Hybrid form to kill Morlun. In that case, Peter not only healed a missing eye, but the tonsils he had removed when he was a child.<\/p><h2>Alternate Versions<\/h2><p><strong>MC2<\/strong><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-142565\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/142565-159442-kaine.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.98630136986301\" data-width=\"365\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 365px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/142565-159442-kaine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-142565\"><img alt=\"Older Kaine\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/142565-159442-kaine.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/142565-159442-kaine.jpg 365w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/142565-159442-kaine.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Older Kaine\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/142565-159442-kaine.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/142565-159442-kaine.jpg 365w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/142565-159442-kaine.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Older Kaine<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Kaine is perhaps the only reason that the MC2 universe is any different than the normal Marvel Universe.

Trying to prove to himself he is not going insane, Ben follows the baits of the vision and eventually finds himself somewhere within the Catskill Mountains confronted by some very real creations of the Jackal that have seemingly hid away within one of his hidden labs since his earlier demise. <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man<\/a> meanwhile begins to suffer from the same visions and, having collapsed from the strain of them, also sets off to find the source, seeing visions of a collapsed Scarlet Spider as he makes his way to the mountains, only adding to his resolve to follow the visions wherever they may be leading him.<\/p><p>Eventually reaching the unconscious Ben and seeing the Jackal like creature that was tormenting him, Peter agrees to team up with Ben to find out what has been going on. Finding their way into the lab the pair are shocked to find that both the creature they followed and the hulking brute that got the better of Ben are also clones of Peter that the Jackal had made. The situation just becomes more confusing when one of the cloning vats in the room begins to open, revealing a new genetically altered Jackal who is now an equal match for the Spider's in power. This causes Scarlet and Spidey to reluctantly let Jackal explain himself so they can get the answers they came for. As tensions unsurprisingly flare, the Jackal adds even more madness to the proceedings by opening another of the cloning vats, revealing to the Spider's surprise the 'original' <a href=\"\/gwen-stacy\/4005-1480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/api\/image\/original\/163357-140411-spidercide.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-163357\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.276\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/api\/image\/original\/163357-140411-spidercide.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-163357\"><img alt=\"Third Clone\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/5361\/163357-140411-spidercide.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/5361\/163357-140411-spidercide.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"><\/a><figcaption>Third Clone<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Peter finds the stress of the situation too much and once again lashes out at Jackal until Gwen manages to calm him down. The peace is short lived when Peter refuses to accept Gwen as the real thing, causing her to burst into tears and Peter to lash out at one of the computer consoles nearby. During this, Jackal psychologically torments Ben trying to provoke a battle between the two Spiders. As more fighting kicks off between Jackal, Jack and Ben, Spidey finally gains some focus and punches Jackal and throws him to the ground, his anger still controlling his actions as Jackal throws more taunts at him. As Gwen slowly begins turning into a pile of goop, revealing she was truly a clone and not the real deal as Jackal had originally claimed, both the Spiders to lash out and beat Jackal before he makes his escape through a mirror looking portal. This leaves Peter and Ben desperately trying to catch up as the lab begins a self destruct sequence. Realising they won't catch Jackal now the pair follow Jack and just barely escape the explosion of the lab. Eventually they leave more confused than ever as Jackal watches on in delight from the distance, neither realising that one cloning vat managed to survive the explosion...<\/p><p>Shortly after, Scarlet Spider's enemy <a href=\"\/kaine\/4005-8667\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine<\/a> (who had been watching everything that happened all along), makes his way through the wreckage of the lab, hoping to find definitive proof that Peter Parker is real and Ben is, like commonly thought, nothing more than a clone. Upon trying to gain the data from the computers a failsafe in the system activates and the vat that managed to survive the lab's earlier explosion opens, revealing another Peter Parker. As this happens the Jackal and Jack arrive and a battle promptly ensues and during the struggle the third Parker manages to sneak out of the lab much to Kaine's annoyance. Eventually the clone makes its way to a road and hitches a lift with a trucker, not sure who he is or where he needs to go, just accepting the truckers offer to keep him company until he remembered something about who he was...<\/p><h3>Who am I?<\/h3><p>After reaching a truck stop the clone sneaks away and makes his way behind a dumpster and curls up into a ball, unable to cope with the strange circumstances that followed his awakening in the strange lab. Eventually he falls asleep as three muggers make their way up to him and surround the clone hoping to rob him. Thanks to his Spider-Sense however, the clone awakens and much to his shock and horror, manages to do some amazing Spider-Man acrobatics and easily defeats the would be muggers. Realising there is something wrong with himself the clone goes into a rage as he tries to comprehend what is happening to him, desperately seeking answers to questions he doesn't even understand to begin with.<\/p><p>The next day the clone sits alone on a bench with his head in his arms, still trying to figure out who he is and where he comes from. Having been at this same bench with his head in his arms for two hours the clone is nudged by a police officer who has been keeping an eye on him, telling the clone to go home and sleep it off. When the clone tells the officer he doesn't remember where his home is the officer doesn't seem concerned in the slightest, telling the clone he should have thought about that before drinking himself into a stupor. Hearing the officer thinks he is nothing but a common drunk the clone gets offended, shouting in surprise causing the officer the tell him to calm down and show some I.D. When the clone isn't able to show any I.D and explains he doesn't remember who he is the officer tells the clone that whether he is drunk or genuinely unable to remember his identity they should head to the police station, causing the already spooked clone's Spider-Sense to go off and causing him to flee following the instinct by jumping onto the nearby building and crawling up the side to safety, the display of even more unusual abilities only scaring the clone more than he already was.<\/p><p>Following the events with the police officer the clone manages to make his way back to where Peter grew up as a child, the vague memories apparently drawing him there as the slowly begin to surface in his mind. While walking the clone is unable to understand why the streets are so familiar but his train of thought is distracted upon hearing someone shouting thief. Once again letting the vague memories take control the clone jumps right in front of the mugger and throws him into some trash cans causing the mugger to reveal a knife. As the mugger tells the clone he should have stayed out of his business he lunges forward with his knife as the clone easily jumps out of the muggers path. As he lands and takes out the thug the clone states that he seems to have some kind of powers and with those comes responsibility, or so he thinks he has been told at some point in his life. The man who was being mugged tells the clone he's a hero and doesn't understand why he is leaving but his words fall on deaf ears, the clone simply walks on whilst saying 'Power and responsibility' to himself. Having found him way onto a rooftop the clone looks down on the city as he states he needs to find out who he is, and he knows where he has to go to do so.<\/p><p>While looking at a paper stand the clone notices a paper with Peter on the cover, having been falsely arrested charged for several murders that were actually caused by Kaine. The clone realises he looks exactly like Peter, and reading the name he realises he has heard it somewhere before, and that he has a mission to do that is one of great responsibility but he is still unsure as to what that mission is exactly and so he moves on hoping to trigger more memories. After walking around for several more hours the clone finds himself at a derelict building that triggers another memory, one that defined his entire life (Where Peter captured Uncle Ben's killer) and as more memories start to flood to him he runs off realizing where he needs to go next to get more answers, all the while being watched from the rooftops by the villain called Scrier. Having made his way to the cemetery the clone collapses as he finally sees the final trigger he needed, the graves of Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and all of the memories of Peter's life begin filling his head in a massive rush driving his already flimsy sanity to its limits as he finally remembers everything and cries out 'I am Parker! PETER PARKER!'<\/p><h3>Family reunion<\/h3><p>With Peter's memories now as his own the clone makes his way back to Aunt May's house in Queens convinced the man in jail for the murders is his clone, and not the other way around like it is in reality. Upon entering his old room the clone's anger grows as he sees the layers of dust that have gathered in Aunt May's absence, partially ruining the memory that the house was May's pride and joy in life that it is now growing cold and uncared for. The reality that Aunt May is now dead tips the clones rage over the edge, the uncertainty of what has happened in his absence coupled with the unknown time of his absence from Peter's memories causes him to lash out and break a table as he cries out to know who did all this to him. Hearing himself become so full of rage causes the clone to snap back to reality, determined to not let whatever has happened destroy him, convinced still that he is the true Peter Parker and not just a clone. Needing to find out who it is in the prison cell under 'his' name the clone sets off in search of more answers.<\/p><p>Having visited the lab of Ben's geneticist friend Seward Trainer in order to find out if Peter's irradiated blood could have an adverse affect on their unborn child Mary Jane makes her way home, unable to stand the stress of both the pregnancy worries and Peter's current confinement in prison. As she walks down the street and past a mancover Kaine's hand appears from below and grabs the unsuspecting woman down into the sewers as she cries out for Peter to help. Believing Kaine is trying to hurt her Mary Jane becomes nervous, unaware that in reality Kaine is actually, and rather out of character, wanting to help her. Upon hearing Kaine tell her that her end is nearer than she could imagine Mary Jane misinterprets the situation and turns a flood pipe on sending Kaine flying back as water gushes out in his direction. Taking her chance to escape <a href=\"\/mary-jane\/4005-13380\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane<\/a> climbs back up the drain's ladder and into the street, intent on escaping from her would be captor only to be pulled aside down an alley by 'Peter', in reality the latest clone, who begs her to help him.<\/p><p>Mary Jane stands stunned as the clone informs her that he isn't the Peter she married and that her husband is just a fraud who stole his life, terrifying her as he screams he is the real Peter Parker. Despite her fear and confusion Mary Jane tells the clone that now isn't the time, she is being chased by Kaine, who promptly appears behind the pair, who tells Mary Jane the clone isn't Peter or Ben, confirming that the man in front of her is yet another clone. Seeing the new clone as the lesser of two evils Mary Jane chooses to believe Kaine is lying to her as the clone begs Mary Jane to believe he is real and not to fall for Kaine's lies. Mary Jane stands stunned at everything that is happening, snapping back to reality only to tell the clone that if he is Peter then prove it by protecting her from Kaine. Still believing all of Peter's memories are his own the clone tells Mary Jane that he always has protected her and always will as he lunges at Kaine and punches the villain into a wall before continuing to pounce at him, only to be headbutted, punched and slammed into the wall for his efforts, knocking him unconscious in the process.<\/p><p>Awakening only a few moments later the clone gives into his anger over the five years he believes he has lost and uses it to push himself onward through the pain and proceeds to climb the building and leap from building to building determined to find and protect Mary Jane from Kaine. Having successfully made her way back to her apartment Mary Jane feels disgusted as she pulls out a gun that she secretly bought and kept hidden from Peter just as 'Peter' appears behind her in his Spider-Man costume. When she cautiously asks if its Peter he says nothing could keep them apart but as Mary Jane looks on she asks him to take his mask off and, much to her horror, she instantly realises it isn't her husband, it is just the latest clone to intrude on her life. She tells the clone to not take another step towards her as she raises the gun and threatens to shoot him if he ignores her. Despite his Spider-Sense going off wildly throughout the clone slowly steps towards to Mary Jane, reaching out to her as if he was her husband, only stopping as the gun goes off and both he and Mary Jane stand looking on shocked. Although the clone isn't shot, the picture of Peter and Mary Jane just inches away from his head is and as Mary Jane drops the gun in horror the clone prepares to go over to comfort her, only to be knocked out once again by Kaine, who has finally caught up with the them.<\/p><p>When Scarlet Spider gets to the apartment he finds 'Peter' laying on the ground and asks why he is there, thinking Peter should still be in prison, and then asks where Mary Jane is. Before the clone can answer the real Peter comes through the door and says that is exactly what he wants to know as the trio stand looking at one another in both shock and confusion...<\/p><h3>Battle with Freakface<\/h3><p>As the clone sees the other Peter he instantly tells both Peter and Ben to get out and leave he and Mary Jane alone, this instantly causing Peter to become enraged and grab the clone telling him he is Peter Parker and he will only ask once more where Mary Jane is. Hearing Peter declare himself the owner of the identity causes the clone to kick Peter across the room and then pouncing towards him telling Peter he won't let his life be taken again, the eventual fight only being stopped by Ben coming between the two demanding they stop and telling them fighting won't help the situation or find Mary Jane before going on to ask, rather embarrassingly, if it really is Peter he is talking too as the clone just stands glaring. As Peter informs Ben of how Judas Traveller helped him escape prison so he could protect Mary Jane from Kaine, the mention of the villain who had tormented Ben so much in the past causing him to become enraged and grabbing the clone and demanding to be told what happened at the apartment. The clone just manages to inform the pair that he was knocked unconscious but didn't see who by and that he doesn't want either of them to save Mary Jane as that is his job but before he can act he passes out once more.<\/p><p>Having followed the signal of Mary Jane's emergency tracer both Spider-Man (Now in a combination of his prison outfit and parts of his old black suit) and Scarlet Spider make their way down into the sewers joined just moments later by the clone who apparently has awakened from his injuries and followed the pair. Again he demands that the two leave and let him save 'his' wife before punching the wall next to him, revealing a hidden passage just metres away from Kaine's hideout. Mary Jane runs for the tunnel but is stopped by Kaine as the trio of Spider-Men enter, the clone shouting for Kaine to get away from his wife as Kaine looks stunned at the head count. When Kaine tells Mary Jane to get back so she won't die the clone pounces at Kaine telling him the only one to die will be his wife's captor. As Kaine punches the clone with ease Peter and Ben join the fight as Mary Jane runs for safety, but during the battle neither Ben, Peter or Kaine notice that the clone has slipped away and followed after Mary Jane. Having caught up with her the clone informs Mary Jane that she doesn't have to run any more but Mary Jane coldly states he isn't Peter just as the real Peter appears behind the clone and punches him in the face. As Peter takes off his mask and Mary Jane falls into his arms knowing that he is truly her husband the clone begins screaming that he is the real Peter Parker and now he has found his wife he has to kill all the imposter's. As Peter tries to lead Mary Jane to safety the clone's behaviour becomes even more erratic just as Mary Jane informs Peter that the other exit has also been blocked by Kaine who stands holding Ben's unconscious body.<\/p><p>The stress of the entire ordeal finally catching up with him causes the clone's genetic trigger to activate and begins to spasm and mutate in front of the horrified Peter and Mary Jane as Kaine reminds them that the clone is just another weapon made by the Jackal before telling the pair to escape, he will take care of the monstrosity now in front of them. Having secretly been playing possum with Kaine up to this point Ben springs awake and kicks Kaine in the face releasing him from the villains grip as Peter and Mary Jane begin making their escape. Having thrown Ben into the clone Kaine proceeds to lunge at it, stating how hideous he is and how the Jackal has truly outdone himself with his latest creation as the clone, still holding onto the belief he is the genuine Parker, telling Kaine that he isn't a genetic tool grown in a lab but he has just had his DNA transformed by Jackal and won't have it restored until he defeats all of Jackal's enemies. As the fight continues the clone begins displaying even more unusual abilities, morphing his hands into giant square fists as he tries to pound both Ben and Kaine into dust as the pair strike up a rather unexpected alliance to take down the latest threat to their lives. Using Ben as a distraction Kaine brings the ceiling down on top of the clone before falling into an argument with his current ally, only to have the clone grow his mass into a hulking behemoth, apparently now able to morph his body at will.<\/p><p>The battle now restarted Kaine throws himself at the clone and grabs his face, preparing to disfigure and kill him with his touch like he has done to many others before. Much to his shock his attack is useless and the clone states his DNA was mutated specifically to stand against Kaine's as Jackal wants him dead and proceeds to stretch his body around Kaine like a snake causing Ben to unleash a flurry of attacks on the clone that only just managed to distract the clone long enough for Kaine to escape his grip. Realising that enclosed area is helping the clone win the battle Ben and Kaine make a run for the surface but as Kaine jumps out from the manhole the entire street begins to burst out from beneath him as the clone appears, only to be hit by a steel girder launched by Peter who stayed behind to help Ben. The clone proceeds to pick up a car and throw it at Peter before running to grab a van to follow it up, only to be hit by a car in return courtesy of Kaine that causes a massive explosion that appears to destroy maniacal clone, rather easily, once and for all.<\/p><h3>The Birth of Spidercide<\/h3><p>Having been secretly resurrected by Scrier the clone rejoins Jackal and aids in his plan to release a new strain of the Carrion virus in Springville, Pennsylvania, now back in the humanoid Peter form he had before his last encounter with the Spiders. Having been the one to release the virus the clone sits emotionless as he watches the people around him collapsing dead in front of him only to have Jackal come over to him and begin joking about the situation, turning the conversation into a chance to get one up on the clone psychologically upon realising the lack of humour in his minions eyes. As the pair stroll down the empty streets and Jackal discusses the father and son relationship between the two the pair fail to notice that down one of the alleyways they pass that one person seems to have survived the Carrion virus' effects and awakens in pain.<\/p><p>Upon hearing about the survivor several hours later via a radio tap to the response team sent to access the cause of the mass deaths in the town Jackal sends the clone out to capture him in order to learn how he was able to avoid what was thought to be certain death. Now wearing his own outfit and his size greatly increased (having gained control of his mutation powers upon being resurrected) the clone sets out into a forest near to Springville and begins to track the survivor, who also has gone through mutations of his own and has become a hulking behemoth, unaware that both Scarlet Spider and the New Warriors are also attempting to find the survivor before he does any damage with his new abilities.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/635752-spidercide1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/635752-spidercide1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/635752-spidercide1.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/635752-spidercide1.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>While the New Warriors and Scarlet Spider battle in the distance, having suffered a case of mistaken identity, the clone manages to catch up with the survivor and asks why he isn't dead before a scream alerts the others of the pair's location after the clone tried to capture him. Seeing the potential nuisance the New Warriors and Scarlet Spider could make for him the clone throws the survivor into the air telling the others to go get him if they want him so badly. Upon doing so the survivor shows his ability to alter his body to suit his surroundings and promptly grows wings. As the New Warriors try to capture the survivor Scarlet Spider is left to deal with the clone, unaware of his identity until the clone reveals that while he is hurt that Ben doesn't remember him he can't be blamed, the last time they met he didn't look as good as he does now before revealing the nickname Ben gave him in the sewers - Freakface.<\/p><p>Ben lunges at the clone upon realising his identity but the clone avoids the attack by turning his arm into water before saying he goes by a much better name now, one given to him by his father, Spidercide. After throwing Justice into Firestar (Having grabbed him by the throat while easily avoiding damage from Scarlet Spider's earlier attack) the clone continues to turn the rest of his body into water and jumps into a nearby stream and tells Ben that he is his own clone now and he (Jackal) has gone back to where it all began. After finally managing to capture the survivor Scarlet Spider and the New Warriors discuss 'the other Spider-Guy' while the helicopter to transport the survivor is loaded, unaware that the pilot is actually Spidercide in disguise...<\/p><h3>Everything is Clear<\/h3><p>During the height of confusion during the clone saga Peter finds himself working alongside Jackal after being told HE is the clone and Ben is actually the original Spider-Man, having saved Jackal from taking a bullet from the Punisher by taking him back to his lab and placing him in one of the cellular regeneration pods. While waiting to find out if the process has saved his new 'mentor' Peter is confronted by Ben, trying to reach out to the traumatised Peter before he does anything rash after finding out the earth shattering news. His pleas of understanding falling on death ears, Ben finds himself being punched by Peter several times before Peter finally relents and walks off into the shadows leaving Ben to look on in disappointment that he couldn't help his 'clone'. Before Ben can do anything more he finds himself being grabbed by the face by Spidercide who states he doesn't think Ben should be there and slams his opponent into the ground before surrounding Ben in his water form trying to drown the intruder to the lab.<\/p><p>After being released from the regeneration pod by Kaine, Jackal decides to check on Kaine's 'brothers' and runs in as Ben finally frees himself from Spidercide's grip, having burst his gel like form, and tells the pair that there won't be any rough housing in his lab. After a few moments of peace more fighting erupts between the Spiders, Kaine and Jackal and none of them notice that Spidercide has left the room and walks into a remote part of the lab having been summoned by Scrier. Spidercide asks who the man is, realising he knows him somehow but unsure of why. Without a word Scrier simply lays a finger on Spidercide's head and in an instant Spidercide understands everything and notes that now everything is clear to him. Having made his way back to the 'family reunion' Spidercide offers to deal with Ben for Jackal after their latest fallout but Jackal denies the request by saying Ben is too important and so orders him to kill Kaine. After a short breakdown Kaine leaves having fallen victim for Jackal's games for the last time and Jackal stands pompously commenting on how Ben must be feeling woozy now after secretly drugging him after swiping him with his claws during the earlier battle. Spidercide proceeds to carry the now semi conscious Scarlet Spider to his room, all the while remaining totally silent.<\/p><p>Having followed Peter and Jackal and listening silently to their conversation Spidercide watches and Peter swings off to find the 'perfect' Gwen Stacey clone and Jackal asks if Spidercide can believe some people can fall for, to which he quietly responds that he can't, all the while grinning as he watches Jackal thinking he has the upper hand. With his other creations busy Jackal proceeds with his studies on the survivor from the Carrion incident in Springville, commenting on how exasperating he finds the man's survival. Spidercide says he can easily destroy the man if it bothers Jackal so much, causing his master to comment on how maybe it escaped his attention but he is no closer to understanding why that one person managed to survive where thousands of others did not. Spidercide then asks why one single anomaly is such a big deal causing Jackal to walk out of the room as he explains one person in such a small town equals thousands worldwide if the virus was released, and that if he is going to eradicate mankind he will do it totally or not at all, leaving Spidercide watching from the shadows of the lab silently.<\/p><p>After surviving an army of bad degenerative Spider-clones Ben and Kaine fall through the labs ceiling causing Jackal to become startled by the intrusion and call for Spidercide but getting no response from his faithful 'son' while mocking him for actually taking the name he gave him. Having made his way to one of the labs computer rooms Jackal finds Spidercide downloading a copy of all of Jackal's data on the Carrion virus and the survivor for Scrier. Enraged that Spidercide is betraying him to Scrier Jackal proceeds to click his fingers to activate the self degeneration sequence he placed in him upon his creation only to find that it does nothing, Spidercide just mockingly joking about the pain as he stands there unaffected before informing Jackal that Scrier removed the degeneration factor during his earlier encounter with the man. While throwing his former master to the ground Spidercide informs Jackal that Scrier found him a disappointment as he prepares to crush him by forming his hands into a giant mace, only to be knocked away by Kaine who finally caught up with the pair.<\/p><p>As Kaine and Spidercide proceed to battle, all the while egged on by Jackal, Kaine begins to suffer from one of his visions about Mary Jane's death, the momentarily lapse in his movements giving Spidercide the chance to grab some machinery and impaling Kaine in the chest for his 'rudeness' of blanking his adversary mid battle. Before Spidercide can impale Kaine again Ben jumps down and knocks Spidercide through a window as the wiled up clone tells Ben not to worry as he has plenty planned for him too. As the pair continue to battle in the next room Ben punches Spidercide into a power line electrocuting the villain but also releasing the survivor from Springville incident from his containment as the room begins to fall apart all around Ben and Spidercide as Jackal sets his degenerated Spider-clone goo on Ben. With Ben distracted and Jackal on the run Spidercide proceeds to follow, the role Scrier gave him not yet complete...<\/p><h3>Splat Goes the Spider<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1964612-spidercide.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1964612-spidercide.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1964612-spidercide.png\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1964612-spidercide.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Setting his master plan into action the Jackal, and several clones of his Jack's, head to the roof of the Daily Bugle and begin laying a Carrion virus bomb which is still not perfected due to all of the distractions Jackal was given by his 'sons'. Scrier then appears to Jackal and orders him to stop what he is doing, only to have Jackal to state his confusion given how both Scrier and Judas Traveller helped him start it all, to which Scrier simply states that it is none of his concern. After pulling a gun on Scrier, which the villain promptly teleports away from Jackal, before Jackal is told the death of humanity cannot be allowed, but HIS death is a necessity and as Spidercide appears behind him ready to continue his mission for Scrier Jackal looks around in shock and disbelief.<\/p><p>Having escaped from the lab with his life Scarlet Spider reaches the Bugle and heads in Jonah Jameson's office telling him to evacuate, aware of Jackal's master plan. Before Jonah can even question why the building needs evacuating both Spidercide and Jackal crash through the ceiling punching one another without regard for anyones safety. As both Jackal and Ben dodge Spidercide's attacks the room continues to get smashed into oblivion so, realising Spidercide is doing more harm than good, Ben tries to stop or at least distract him only for the hulking Spider to continue regardless as Jackal and Ben bicker between themselves.<\/p><p>Noticing that some of the Bugle's staff are in danger Ben jumps to save them with his webbing, but as he does Spidercide takes the opportunity to smash Ben's twisted ankle with his hammer shaped hand allowing him to focus on killing Jackal. After pinning Jackal to the wall Spidercide is shocked as the wall begins to melt behind his father, Jackal using a concealed gun to get out of the tight situation leaving the pair to fall from the building with little regard for their lives. Ben shoots webbing to save the pair, still maintaining his ethics despite all the torture he has suffered from them both but the webbing only manages to grab a hold of Jackal's leg leaving Spidercide to fall to the streets below screaming in anger.<\/p><p>After managing to stop bomb from going off and Jackal dying from another fall from the building Ben, Peter, Mary Jane and the Gwen clone make their way down to the streets which are now filled with police. One of the officers calls the Peter and Ben over and tells them they've got a blob of 'something' to which Ben tells him to call Spidercide, before the officer informs them that they put it into a stasis chamber because although it looked pretty dead they didn't know if it was still a threat to which the pair seem to agree is best, although it leaves Spidercide's exact wellbeing unknown...<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>Spidercide has all the abilities and powers that Spider-Man has and then some.

He is also a successful scientist. He calls himself The Spider-Man.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p>Aaron Aikman was a young brilliant scientist living in a different reality then the Main Marvel Universe. At 27 years, he already worked for one of the most prominent research-labs in the world, Ikegami. With his intellect, he started expermenting with spider-DNA and eventually mixed his own DNA with that of cloned spider genes. Gaining spider-like powers, Aaron designed a technical suit and became a hero named The Spider-Man. Aaron was romantically involved with his boss Kaora Ikegami. The relationship however stranded after Kaori's 10 year old daughter had a car-accident and was left braindead. The strain of it seemingly caused a rift between the two. Aaron continued his work at Ikegami and also fought crime as The Spider-Man. His identity was not known to many people, except for Kaora.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Aaron Aikman, also known as The Spider-Man, was created by Dustin Weaver and first appeared in <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/edge-of-spider-verse-3-aaron-aikman-the-spider-man\/4000-466326\/\">Edge of Spider-Verse #3<\/a> (2014).<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Edge of Spider-Verse and Seeming Death<\/h3><p>Over the course of weeks, Aaron noticed a number of abductions of humans by a strange cyborg-like creature named Naamurah. After one defeat against Naamurah, Aaron improved his webs and suit and eventually captured, whom he thought to be Naamurah. It was however a different creature, with the same cyborg-like appearances. Studying it, the desings traced back to his former lover Kaora Ikegami. Aaron whent to Kaora's lab and confronted her as The Spider-Man. Eventually Kaora told Aaron that she had tried to revivive her daughter. She did this with cyborg implants and seemingly at first managed to bring her daughter's mind back into her body. This however did not last long, since a strange new identity soon took recidence in the body of her daughter. The creature requested more humans that should receive the cyborg implants. At that point, Kaora told Aaron that she had been experminenting for months and that there where over a dozen of these cyborg creatures running around. Kaora knew she had done wrong and was repentfull. Shocked and horrified, Aaron rushed out of the lab, wanting to stop the swarm of cyborg-like zombies. <br \/>However, at that point, the Inheritor known as <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/morlun\/4005-17613\/\">Morlun<\/a> stood in his path as he crossed the hall. THe only thing Aaron could say is \"Who are you\", on which Morlun responded; \"The end of your story\".<\/p><p>It is not seen on pannel that Aaron was killed, but it is highly likely that he was killed by Morlun, since Morlun later appeared fighting agianst the other Spider-Men during Spider-Verse and Aaron Aikman was not seen agian besides a brief cameo on a monitor.<\/p><p>

When he first appeared on the scene he was introduced as a highly intelligent crook, being equipped with a multitude of gadgets of his own design, and was setting himself up as a criminal mastermind, recruiting villains for his upcoming plots.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">First he rescued the safe-cracker Ordini from the Police, then he broke out the inventor Professor Pelham from a maximum security prison, filling them in on the details for a daring robbery.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Spider's criminal career was however, quite short lived. After a couple of his plots were foiled by the police he started to become embroiled in various rivalries with other criminals. Eventually The Spider became disillusioned with his life of crime, finding that he found it far more interesting to pit his wits against other criminals than he ever had against the Police, he had always been rather honourable to be a criminal anyway, often being careful not to actually hurt anyone, including cops.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Spider, Pelham, and Ordini decided to become full time crime-fighters<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Spider was created by Ted Cowan and Reg Bunn for the anthology comic Lion, with him making his first appearance in the June 26th 1965 issue.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After his initial set of stories Ted Cowan left the character, and writing duties were handed over to Jerry Siegel, co-creator of Superman. Jerry Siegel worked on the character with Reg Bunn for most of his stories, creating many weird and wonderful characters and settings.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After its initial run the strip was reprinted multiple times, first in Lion itself, and then later in Vulcan.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>The Spider V the Sinister Seven<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Spider has a series of dangerous encounters and each time a different superhero turns up out of the Blue to help him at the last moment, after some time it is revealed that each encounter was actually a part of a test to judge the Spider's worthiness; there's a group of adventurers who have decided to band together to form a team named the Society of Heroes, and they want The Spider to join them.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Society of Heroes, Tigro, Snowman, Captain Whiz, Rex Robot, Mr Gizmo, and Rockman, have learned of a plot by the mastermind Limbo the Unknown to create his own team of villains \"The Sinister Seven\" and none of them believe that they can overcome the team working alone.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After a scuffle between The Society and the powerful Limbo himself, The Spider is convinced of the threat that the Sinister Seven represents to the world, and he agrees to join the Society of Heroes.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Limbo tricks The Spider's friends, Professor Pelham, and Ordini into dropping a bomb on the Society whilst they are in their base, but disaster is narrowly averted when the Spider manages to shoot the bomb with reverse gravity webbing, causing it to float away harmlessly. Unfortunately the rest of the society are out for blood, trying to kill Pelham and Ordini for attacking them, but the Spider manages to calm his hotheaded colleagues down and explain the situation.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After some time and a lot of minor successes in the fight against crime for the new Society of Heroes, Limbo finally puts his plan into action. The Sinister Seven, made up of Limbo, Muto, The Living Totem, The Shark, Gas Man, Mad Mechanoid, and Sylvester \"Silly\" Jenkins decide to kidnap hundred's of Earth's men, intending to sell them to aliens as slaves.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After an epic battle the Society of Heroes eventually triumph against the Sinister Seven, unfortunately its a rather Pyrrhic victory as every member of the Society of Heroes bar The Spider dies horribly.<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Spider is a highly intelligent gadget-user, he has a gun which fires a steel-strong strand of webbing, a jet-pack, and enhanced strength and agility. He has also been known to be able to hypnotise people into hallucinating whatever he wants just by looking them in the eyes.<\/p><h2>Other Versions<\/h2><h3>Albion<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In this miniseries from Wildstorm all of the old British comic books are revealed to have taken their inspiration from real people, people who have been detained in a secret prison for many years.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Here The Spider was the one who originally captured most of these super-powered humans whilst on a mission for the British government, but afterwards he was double-crossed and also imprisoned.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Spider, along with other classic characters work out a plan and eventually manage to escape.<\/p><h3>Captain Britain<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">An analogue of The Spider, named \"The Arachnid\" was mentioned in Alan Moore's well liked Captain Britain story \"Crooked World\". Here the character was a hero of an alternate dimension Earth 238, a world populated by versions of characters from old Valiant and Lion comics.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The heroes of Earth 238 had been killed by a robot named The Fury, a construction that had been built by Mad Jim Jaspers to search out and destroy all super-powered beings.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-287117\/","id":287117,"name":null,"issue_number":"650626"},"gender":1,"id":44698,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/square_avatar\/11112\/111127013\/4062461-king.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11112\/111127013\/4062461-king.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/screen_medium\/11112\/111127013\/4062461-king.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/screen_kubrick\/11112\/111127013\/4062461-king.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111127013\/4062461-king.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_large\/11112\/111127013\/4062461-king.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/11112\/111127013\/4062461-king.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/square_mini\/11112\/111127013\/4062461-king.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111127013\/4062461-king.jpg","image_tags":"All Images"},"name":"The Spider","origin":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-4\/","id":4,"name":"Human"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-2053\/","id":2053,"name":"IPC Magazines Ltd."},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/the-spider\/4005-44698\/","resource_type":"character"},{"aliases":"Richard Wentworth\nMaster of Men","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-18576\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":74,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:50","date_last_updated":"2023-11-26 02:02:58","deck":"The world knows Richard Wentworth as a decorated war hero and the son of a wealthy industrialist - but only a few confidants know the truth.

In this version of The Spider, Richard Wentworth is still an army officer with advanced level training which enables him to carry out his vigilante life as The Spider. He is highly intellectual and has a strong, almost extreme, morale stance. He is also somewhat of an inventor, creating many of the gadgets he uses in his war on crime himself. During his service in the military Wentworth went missing in action during a Black Ops mission. How he escaped, who captured him and exactly how long he was gone for have not been fully revealed. Although it is stated he was gone for a number of years. When Wentworth returned to New York, he was appalled by the degradation of the city and due to his strong beliefs in justice, decided to adopt the role of The Spider.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2737245-the_spider_october_1933.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2737245\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4178217821782\" data-width=\"505\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 505px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2737245-the_spider_october_1933.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2737245\"><img alt=\"The Spider #1 (1933)\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117930\/2737245-the_spider_october_1933.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2737245-the_spider_october_1933.jpg 505w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117930\/2737245-the_spider_october_1933.jpg 451w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" data-width=\"451\"><\/a><figcaption>The Spider #1 (1933)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Spider was created by <a href=\"\/henry-steeger\/4040-64468\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-64468\">Harry Steeger<\/a> for <a href=\"\/popular-publications\/4010-3783\/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-3783\">Popular Publications<\/a> in 1933 as competition for rival publisher <a href=\"\/street-smith\/4010-1891\/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1891\">Street &amp; Smith Publications<\/a>' vigilante hero <a href=\"\/the-shadow\/4005-28923\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28923\">The Shadow<\/a>.

Assuming a hunchbacked and shambling gait, this new creation terrified both the underworld and the police.<\/p><p>The Spider was often aided and accompanied by his faithful band of servants, most notably his courageous Sikh manservant \"Singh\", who followed Richard with almost religious zeal. <a href=\"\/ram-singh\/4005-84188\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84188\">Singh<\/a> veiwed Richard Wentworth as \"The greatest warrior he had ever known\".

The Spider was violent and ruthless to the extreme. In times of reflection he would often play the violin, much like another world famous sleuth. Wentworth would at times venture into the Underworld disguised as small time villain Blinky McQuade in order to gain information.<\/p><h3>Dynamite Entertainment<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2858431-spider1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2858431\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1626373626374\" data-width=\"455\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 455px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2858431-spider1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2858431\"><img alt=\"Richard and Nita\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2858431-spider1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2858431-spider1.jpg 455w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Richard and Nita\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2858431-spider1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2858431-spider1.jpg 455w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-width=\"550\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Richard and Nita<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The 2012 Dynamite series is set in current times but contains a strong element of 1930's pulp fiction. As Wentworth didn't expect to return alive from a black ops mission, he decided to end his engagement with Nita Van Sloan in order to spare her grief. However Wentworth did return, although years later and by this time Nita was married to Police Commissioner <a href=\"\/stanley-kirkpatrick\/4005-84189\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84189\">Stanley Kirkpatrick<\/a> - a close friend of Richard. Unable to quell his love for Nita, Richard confides in her that he is The Spider in an attempt to keep a semblance of a relationship with her. This relationship forms a major part of the ongoing story of the series. It is also the reason why Richard Wentworth has turned into an alcoholic.<\/p><p>Meanwhile Richard acts as a special consultant to the police, giving him access to crime scenes and police reports which he uses to the benefit of The Spider. Wentworth is also the son of a wealthy chemical manufacturer whose company deals in chemical weapons. Unable to accept his father's line of work, Richard has an extremely stormy relationship with his dad. However after his father's death Richard inherits the company and attempts to change its direction.<\/p><p>The Spider's cast of original support characters have also returned in moderinsed form. His former servant Ram Singh is now his best friend and lawyer and one of the only two people who know for certain that Richard Wentworth is The Spider. Ezra Brownlee returns as a University professor and an old family friend who helps Richard in his consultancy work. Ronald Jackson is also back as a former soldier who served with Richard in the army and The Spider's getaway driver.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3><b>Terror Of The Zombie Queen<\/b><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2756923-anput.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2756923\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.716\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:171.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2756923-anput.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2756923\"><img alt=\"Anput, the Zombie Queen\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2756923-anput.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2756923-anput.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Anput, the Zombie Queen\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2756923-anput.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/11\/117930\/2756923-anput.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Anput, the Zombie Queen<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A new danger rises in New York as the deranged terrorist <a href=\"\/anput\/4005-84190\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84190\">Anput<\/a> launches a series of attacks using a gas that turns ordinary citizens into mindless zombies, bringing the city and the police force to its knees.

A drug addict in his youth, Eric Needham turned to crime to support his habit. After numerous petty thefts and muggings, Needham attempted armed robbery, breaking into a liquor store and inadvertently killing a man who turned out to be Needham's own father.<\/p><p>Going almost insane with the remorse he felt, Needham kicked his drug habit and sought vengeance against dealers everywhere. Learning of Needham's obsession, a mysterious force supplied him with extensive training, a colorful costume and sophisticated weaponry. Since he intended to prey on criminal \"flies\" Needham took the name Black Spider.<\/p><p>It later emerged that the man funding the Black Spider was <a href=\"\/hanniball-hardwicke\/4005-34468\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34468\">Hanniball Hardwicke<\/a> - drug king of <a href=\"..\/..\/gotham-city\/34-23611\/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gotham City<\/a> - who was using Needham to eliminate his criminal rivals and Needham when the time was necessary. When Needham found out he tried to kill Hardwicke but was foiled by <a href=\"\/batman\/4005-1699\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman<\/a>. Over the years Needhams continued confrontations with Batman reached the stage where Needham went as far as allying himself with the costumed criminals Batman had put away in hopes of eliminating the Dark Knight, each attempt failed one after the other. Needham later found out he had fathered a son (Michael) from a junkie (Linda) whom he had been intimately involved with during his time as an addict, despite this he still persisted his war against the drug lords of Gotham (largely due to the fact that Linda was still hooked on heroin) . During one of the drug buys, he was able to obtain information from one of the buyers as to the whereabouts of one of the key suppliers and would have killed the buyer had Batman not intervened and barely avoiding capture by the Dark knight. Unfortunately as it turned the man Black Spider interrogated was Linda's supplier and word got back to the main distributor Bret Yale who had his men supply her with a fatal dose of heroin. When Needham returned home he found both Linda and Michael dead from heroin. It appeared that Michael had woken up to get a snack and found what he thought was sugar inside part of a serial packet (Linda's secret stash of heroin) and sprinkled it on his cereal unaware he had actually laced his cereal with heroin he died minutes later. Devastated that Linda and his son had died as a indirect result of his own actions Needham now felt he had nothing to loose and decided to target Yale's warehouse and finish the gangs operation once and for all but not before writing a note for Batman to read detailing the whereabouts of Yale's drug front in case Needham failed. Needham approached the warehouse and managed to kill many of Yale's men but was over powered by the remaining members and gunned down critically wounding him. There the gang took him into the warehouse and brought him before Yale himself who mocked Needham and prepared to kill Needham with the very thing he had overcome and sought to rid Gotham of (Heroin). As Yale prepared to administer the lethal shot of heroin to Needham, Batman arrived preventing this and took down the gang member. As the Caped Crusader was in the process of apprehending Yale he was suddenly pushed through the window of the warehouse by Needham and only narrowly survived by grappling to a nearby flag pole. While Yale was somewhat surprised by this he took pleasure in taunting Needham gloating \"Too bad you won't die stoned\"! As it turned out it was Needham who had the last laugh as he lifted up the shirt of his costume revealing plastic explosives strapped to his back. Batman could only watch from the distance as the warehouse exploded killing Needham, Yale and the rest of the gang in the process effectively shutting them down for good. Needham was later seen in the comic book <a href=\"\/the-sandman\/4050-4207\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4207\">Sandman<\/a> where his soul was sent to <a href=\"\/hell\/4020-42471\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">Hell<\/a> however he eventually escaped from there when <a href=\"\/lucifer-morningstar\/4005-24232\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24232\">Lucifer<\/a> abdicated his thrown.

Apart from rare specials however, the character's entire saga is contained in the sixty-issue Transmetropolitan series and he met his natural conclusion at the end of the run.

After the incident Spider is beaten up by the Police because of his column.<\/p><h3>Lust for Life<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2093994\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 604px\" data-ratio=\"0.34437086092715\" data-width=\"604\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:34.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2093994\"><img alt=\"Spider &amp; Channon\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png 604w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider &amp; Channon\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png 604w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2093994-spiderjerusalem_1.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spider &amp; Channon<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/channon-yarrow\/4005-15815\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15815\">Channon Yarrow<\/a>, a stripper Spider encounters in Angels 8, shows up in Spider's apartment.

To get his word out, Spider now uses the pirate news station Hole Feed Site, to avoid Callahan's laws. Spider follows his many leads and lets out Smiler's dirty secrets. Spider informs the media that Smiler is forcing his wife to stay silent and at home, that he had whores over when he was staying in a hotel, what really happened in the Dante Street massacre, and that his presidential adviser was a pedophile. This leads his adviser to kill himself.

They walk and talk around the city and end up in a bar. While going to the bathroom, Spider and his crew get held up by men in anyone-suits. Spider holds them off by making fun of them, then whips out his gun, quickly killing two of the three men. Almost shot in the face, Spider is saved by <a href=\"\/channon-yarrow\/4005-15815\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15815\">Channon<\/a>. The two that run Hole Feed Site wonder what is going on, and Spider says that it's a message from the Smiler. The message is that Smiler knows Spider's still out there, and he's still after him. Spider and the Hole Feed Site owners come to an agreement that Spider will write a weekly column for free. Later, Spider is in his new hotel room and Yelena asks him about his gun training and how many people he has killed. Spider claims that he's killed sixteen, all in self defense, with the exception of one.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094003-spiderjerusalem_10.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2094003\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 409px\" data-ratio=\"0.7481662591687\" data-width=\"409\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094003-spiderjerusalem_10.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2094003\"><img alt=\"Sick\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094003-spiderjerusalem_10.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094003-spiderjerusalem_10.png 409w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094003-spiderjerusalem_10.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sick\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094003-spiderjerusalem_10.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094003-spiderjerusalem_10.png 409w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094003-spiderjerusalem_10.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Sick<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Yelena wants to know more, but Spider won't respond, and leaves the room. <a href=\"\/yelena-rossini\/4005-15814\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15814\">Yelena<\/a> notices Spider's strange behavior, and that he's become very forgetful.

He rushes out and catches a cab with his assistants, further looking into the report, noticing that it's strange that there's no police backup to take out the gunman. He stops the cab at Dante Street and tells Yelena to call Royce to see if he's okay, she tells him he is, then Spider claims that the cops are committing an act called Blue Flu: \"A secretly organized stunt where cops absent themselves from duty claiming illness.\" He states that he knows a human cop that works Dante Street, and if it really is Blue Flu, she'd know. Spider and his assistants notice an odd change in weather, suddenly becoming stormy. Spider sets up a meeting with his mystery informant, and it is revealed to be none other than Detective Newton from Dante Street.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2094007\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 577px\" data-ratio=\"1.4298093587522\" data-width=\"577\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2094007\"><img alt=\"Deadline\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-width=\"447\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png 577w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png 447w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Deadline\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png 577w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094007-spiderjerusalem_14.png 447w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-width=\"447\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Deadline<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Newton confirms that it is in fact Blue Flu, and that it was suggested the police be off the streets because something big is coming, and it's not just the sniper.

The gang run into a bar for safety, and Spider tells them to see if he can write his column in the back room. Admiring the storm, a sudden explosion from the lightning knocks Spider out and covers him in shards of glass. Yelena and Channon drag him into the back room. Channon performs first aid while Yelena starts to write Spider's column.<\/p><p>Spider is trapped in his mind, at first thinking he's dead, and that he'd been sent to Hell because he has no cigarettes. In the blackness, he states that this isn't the way he had imagined dying, and that he would've expected an audience. Spider deduces that he's in a coma, and soon wakes up in Yelena's home. A doctor informs him that he has caught an i-pollen infection: a disease that causes cognition damage, memory loss, intense hallucinations, and motor control damage. Spider is told that he has a two percent chance of survival, and that he only has about a year until he completely loses it. Spider then asks for his assistants to get him a machine so he can get his column in, Yelena informs him that he's been out for four days, and that she wrote his column under his name. He kisses her on the forehead and thanks her, and also thanks Channon after she gives him a new pair of glasses. Spider won't take death lying down, he says that he's now got a deadline, and he is intent on finishing his mission.<\/p><p>After Yelena's father gives Spider permission to use his home as a base of operations, Spider goes to ruin Smiler's press conference. He passes out disks containing information on the set-up of Vita's assassination, then reveals that many current murders have been committed by men in blur suits, suits that are highly used by the Secret Service. Yelena activates a disruptor, revealing men in blur suits to the crowd. Callahan starts to lose his cool, stating that Spider's insane because of his disease, and that he has no evidence. Spider claims he doesn't need evidence because he's not an accredited reporter, that he's not dying until Smiler's gone from presidency, and that the next time they see each other will be the last.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2094009\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 625px\" data-ratio=\"1.5552\" data-width=\"625\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2094009\"><img alt=\"Smiler's done for\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" data-width=\"411\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png 625w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png 411w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Smiler's done for\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png 625w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png 480w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100647\/2094009-spiderjerusalem_16.png 411w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" data-width=\"411\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Smiler's done for<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Knowing that he's going to die, Spider tries to be at peace, and resolve all of his issues.

This is first seen in Transmetropolitan #6 where his initial speech is:<\/p><blockquote><p>Thats it! that's the absolute fucking limit! Thieves! the goddamn lot of you! Thieves and Leeches! Fucking Vampires sucking the will from people whose only goddamn crimes were to be frightened and tired! and you don't help them! You don't listen to them! They get no truth from you! All you do is scare them with stories of something that doesn't exist! And you bastards are winning, Hundreds more of you everyday! Getting away with it in a place so noisy, no one could hear the truth if it were ever told, and I can't fight you alone, you fucks, couldn't when I was a kid and my dad turned cultist and I can't now---all I can do is tell the truth<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Spider also shows signs of a socialist belief. His socialist beliefs can be seen with his reaction to state of Angels 8 and the Cluny State community estate. He is highly anti-social and on many occasions repulses the characters of opposite sex. To achieve his goals he viciously uses violence of any sort. Spider Jerusalem was a chronic smoker and in many instances he is not seen without a cigarette in his mouth. It is also to be noted that Spider's personality is largely based on real life gonzo journalism founder Hunter S. Thompson.<\/p><h2>Weapons and Abilities<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/150324-48312-spider-jerusalem.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-150324\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.705\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/150324-48312-spider-jerusalem.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-150324\"><img alt=\"'Nuff said\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/150324-48312-spider-jerusalem.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/150324-48312-spider-jerusalem.jpg 400w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/150324-48312-spider-jerusalem.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"'Nuff said\" src=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/150324-48312-spider-jerusalem.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/150324-48312-spider-jerusalem.jpg 400w, https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/77\/150324-48312-spider-jerusalem.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>'Nuff said<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Spider owns a great array of firearms and explosives and uses them frequently in the series.

Not showing hints of any martial arts, he mostly uses simple but brutal blows to the groin, to the stomach and to the head. Throughout the series he brings down many opponents, even ones with a better training. Spider is also known for his many gadgets, such as his glasses which he uses as a camera, for both video, and photos, they automatically take pictures when they think he's being attacked. He's also been seen using a gadget that when activated, it sound proofs a room from any recording devices. Spider also has various immunities to certain diseases and infections that he has purchased. Spider is very capable when it comes to technology, such as televisions and computers as well.<\/p><h2>Other Media<\/h2><p>In 2003, Ellis and Robertson were approached by Patrick Stewart's film production company Flying Freehold Productions to develop a Transmetropolitan movie. Later, it was proposed that they create an online animated series with Patrick Stewart voicing Spider Jerusalem. Sadly, both of those plans never came to fruition. Both Ellis and Robertson have stated that they would enjoy seeing actor Tim Roth play Spider if a movie were to ever happen.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-44069\/","id":44069,"name":"The Summer of the Year","issue_number":"1"},"gender":1,"id":15813,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/square_avatar\/6\/62778\/1643340-transmetropolitan.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/62778\/1643340-transmetropolitan.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/screen_medium\/6\/62778\/1643340-transmetropolitan.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/screen_kubrick\/6\/62778\/1643340-transmetropolitan.png","small_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62778\/1643340-transmetropolitan.png","super_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_large\/6\/62778\/1643340-transmetropolitan.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/6\/62778\/1643340-transmetropolitan.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/square_mini\/6\/62778\/1643340-transmetropolitan.png","original_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/6\/62778\/1643340-transmetropolitan.png","image_tags":"All Images,Spider Jerusalem"},"name":"Spider Jerusalem","origin":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-4\/","id":4,"name":"Human"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-521\/","id":521,"name":"Creator-Owned"},"real_name":"Spider Django Heraclitus Jerusalem","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/spider-jerusalem\/4005-15813\/","resource_type":"character"},{"aliases":"May Reilly","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-109604\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":29,"date_added":"2014-11-13 01:19:42","date_last_updated":"2018-03-11 10:10:52","deck":"May Reilly, also known as Lady Spider, is the Spider Woman of Earth-803.

Kate and Bette later respond to a break-in at Evan Blake's apartment, only to be attacked by the costumed art thief Wolf Spider, who poisons Kate and pushes her off the building. Kate survives the fall, but Wolf Spider escapes. Wolf Spider is later revealed to have been hired by Nathan Grantham to steal the paintings, as Grantham believes they contain clues leading to the fortune Eisenstadt took from his family decades earlier. Wolf Spider tracks one of the paintings to Arkham Asylum- where he's hypnotized into freeing <a href=\"\/nocturna\/4005-31028\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31028\">Nocturna<\/a>- and the other to the Kane Estate. After recovering the paintings, Grantham and Wolf Spider find the location of Grantham's family's fortune under a statue of Grantham's grandfather. Grantham runs his car into the statue, which falls on him and kills him. Wolf Spider escapes with the money, but ends up dumping it in Slaughter Swamp as he considers it to be \"blood money.\"<\/p><p>Later, Kate runs into Evan Blake again, whose shoes have been ruined by

However, even though they returned to Earth-65, it was not the timeline of Gwen's usual world. Spider-Zero told Gwen that somewhere amongst the future, someone had developed an invention to blast parts of themselves so they could live on forever. When the invention was used, it was flawed, and the blast hit Gwen. Spider-Zero said that parts of Gwen had manifested itselves as versions of her as other heroes.<\/p><h2>Personal Information<\/h2><h4>Appearance<\/h4><ul><li><strong>Eye Color:<\/strong> Green<\/li><li><strong>Hair Color:<\/strong> Brown<\/li><\/ul><h4>General Information<\/h4><ul><li><strong>Gender:<\/strong> Female<\/li><li><strong>Status:<\/strong> Alive<\/li><\/ul><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>Spider-Zero has spider-related powers.

What is known is that he was trained by <a href=\"\/taskmaster\/4005-4578\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4578\">Taskmaster<\/a> as a member of an evil version of the <a href=\"\/avengers\/4060-3806\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers<\/a>. Blood Spider was trained to be a version of <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man<\/a> while his team-mates <a href=\"\/jagged-bow\/4005-15516\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15516\">Jagged Bow<\/a> and <a href=\"\/deathshield\/4005-47789\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47789\">Deathshield<\/a> were trained to be versions of <a href=\"\/clint-barton\/4005-1475\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye<\/a> and <a href=\"\/captain-america\/4005-1442\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Powers and abilities<\/h3><p>Of the trio, the Blood Spider was the only character who displayed any superhuman abilities. He was able to shatter a solid concrete wall with a very powerful move, indicating he possessed some degree of superhuman strength. His stamina was also heightened to similar levels. He was not as powerful as Spider-Man, and not nearly as fast. He was able to offer the wall-crawler only momentary resistance before being dispatched.<\/p><p>His reflexes and agility were highly developed, but did not appear to reach a superhuman level. He had limited skill as a hand-to-hand combatant.<\/p><p>He carried a back pack and wrist devices capable of shooting webbing similar to that of Spider-Man, but much weaker. An ordinary human in peak physical condition, such as <a href=\"\/solo\/4005-15485\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15485\">Solo<\/a>, was able to tear through it, which would not have been possible with Spider-Man's webbing.<\/p><p>Apparently, the Blood Spider had not been trained by the Taskmaster for very long as he was not an outstanding hand-to-hand combatant as most of Taskmaster's students, such as <a href=\"\/usagent\/4005-14992\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\">US Agent<\/a>. Blood Spider demonstrated little technique and fought with sheer brute force.<\/p><h3>Costume<\/h3><p>The costume worn by Blood Spider has several design elements that <a href=\"\/mark-bagley\/4040-2123\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-2123\">Mark Bagley<\/a> would later incorporate into his redesign of Spider-Man's costume during the Ben Reilly years. The most prominent of the traits is the use of a larger, symmetrical spider emblem on the front and back, the legs of which meet on the shoulders.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-64591\/","id":64591,"name":"Skullduggery","issue_number":"367"},"gender":1,"id":15517,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/84857\/3161418-bloodsp.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/84857\/3161418-bloodsp.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/84857\/3161418-bloodsp.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/screen_kubrick\/8\/84857\/3161418-bloodsp.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/84857\/3161418-bloodsp.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/84857\/3161418-bloodsp.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/84857\/3161418-bloodsp.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/84857\/3161418-bloodsp.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a\/uploads\/original\/8\/84857\/3161418-bloodsp.jpg","image_tags":"All Images"},"name":"Blood Spider","origin":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-4\/","id":4,"name":"Human"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":"Michael Bingham","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/blood-spider\/4005-15517\/","resource_type":"character"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-183108\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":8,"date_added":"2023-05-05 13:33:31","date_last_updated":"2023-05-05 13:47:56","deck":"Jurassic version of Spider-Man.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p>When an arachnid-alloyed asteroid collided with mild-mannered pterodactyl Pter Ptarker during a terrifying Tyrannosaurus trampling, Pter gained the web-slinging dino-might of Spider-Rex.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-940234\/","id":940234,"name":"Something Wicked This Way Comes; The Hero Within; Spider-Rex!; My Dame...
